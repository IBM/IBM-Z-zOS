# z/OSMF sample code.
This repository contains samples of [IBM z/OS® Management Facility (z/OSMF)](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/zos-management-facility) which can be used to demonstrate its functions. z/OSMF improves programmer productivity by using simplified, streamlined and automated tasks. This easier-to-use functionality reduces both programmer training time and the learning curve of [IBM® z/OS® operating system](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/zos).
