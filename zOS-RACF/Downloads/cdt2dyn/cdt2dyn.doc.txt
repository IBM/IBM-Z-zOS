ABOUT CDT2DYN

  This program will examine the contents of the current classes
  in the RACF static class descriptor table.  (Any
  existing dynamic classes will be ignored.)  For all static
  installation-defined classes, it will create the commands
  necessary to put those installation-defined classes into the
  dynamic CDT (BUILDCMD parameter).  It can then execute the
  commands which were built (RUNCMD parameter), which will define
  the dynamic classes in the CDT general resource class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO INVOKE CDT2DYN

   From the TSO command line, execute the REXX EXEC from the
   dataset in which it resides.  For example:

   EXEC 'data.set.name(CDT2DYN)'
          - or -
   EXEC 'prefix.CDT2DYN.EXEC'

   Optional Parameters:
           BUILDCMD | NOBUILDCMD  Default is BUILDCMD
             Specify BUILDCMD if you want to build commands
               to define dynamic classes from your current
               installation classes in the CDT.
             Specify NOBUILDCMD if you do not want to build
               the commands.  You can specify this with the
               RUNCMD parameter if you have already built your
               commands, optionally edited the commands, and
               now you want to run them.
           RUNCMD   | NORUNCMD    Default is NORUNCMD
             Specify RUNCMD to run the commands built by this
               utility.
             Specify NORUNCMD if you do not want to run the
               commands built by this utility.  You may want to
               edit or examine the commands before they are
               executed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT OF CDT2DYN

   The dataset 'prefix.DYNCLAS.EXEC' is created and optionally
   executed.  If this dataset already exists, it will be
   overwritten.  The existing dataset must have RECFM=V or
   RECFM=F and LRECL=255 for the utility to run properly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESTRICTIONS

   This utility must be run on a z/OS Version 1 Release 6 system
   or later with a TSO/E environment available.
   If the commands built by this utility are run
   on a prior z/OS system, the commands will fail as the CDT
   class and the CDTINFO keyword are new in z/OS V1R6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPICAL USAGE SCENARIO

     1) Build commands to define the dynamic classes:
          EXEC 'prefix.REXX.EXEC(CDT2DYN)'
        Note: With no parameters, this will build the commands
        and put them into dataset prefix.DYNCLAS.EXEC but will
        not run them.
     2) Examine commands in prefix.DYNCLAS.EXEC produced by the
        CDT2DYN utility.  Normally no changes are necessary
        for these commands.  Your installation may require
        changes to them, such as adding an OWNER keyword.
     3) Run the commands to define the dynamic classes:
           EXEC 'prefix.REXX.EXEC(CDT2DYN)' 'NOBUILDCMD RUNCMD'
        Note: This will run the commands built in Step 1).
              It must be run by a user with one of the following
              authorities:
              a) RACF SPECIAL authority
               - or -
              b) CLAUTH authority to the CDT class and
                 (if the FIELD class is active and RACLISTed)
                 FIELD class access to the CDTINFO segment
                 fields (see the RACF Security Administrator's
                 Guide for more information).
     4) Put the dynamic classes into the CDT:
           SETROPTS CLASSACT(CDT) RACLIST(CDT)
               - or -
           SETROPTS RACLIST(CDT) REFRESH
        Note: These commands must be run by a user with
              appropriate authority, as documented in the
              RACF Command Language Reference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOMIZATION

There are 2 statements near the beginning of the CDT2DYN EXEC
that may be changed to tailor this exec to work at your
installation.

output_dataset = "DYNCLAS.EXEC"
  Change this if you want to use a different dataset
  name for the output file.
  Note: The name will be prefixed with your TSO prefix,
  unless you provide a string enclosed in single quotes.

dataset_attributes = 'SPACE(1,1)'
  Change this if you want to use different parameters on
  the ALLOCATE command for the output file.  Do not include
  or change RECFM, BLKSIZE, or LRECL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVISION HISTORY

2004 May 24  - 1.0.00 Restricted release
2004 Sept 24 - 1.0.01 General release
     Fix ALLOCATE statements by adding 'address TSO' and
     fix multi-line command.
     Add start message and parameter messages.
     Add logic to handle NOBUILDCMD NORUNCMD.
     Add logic to handle case where no commands are built.
     Skip classes that are already duplicated by a dynamic one.
