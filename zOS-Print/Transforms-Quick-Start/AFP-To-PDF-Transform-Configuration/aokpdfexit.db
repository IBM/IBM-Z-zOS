# FILENAME:   /usr/lpp/Printsrv/samples/aokpdfexit.db
#
# This sample file is used with the sample AOP to PDF transform password exit,
# /usr/lpp/Printsrv/lib/aokpdfexit.dll. This file maps identifiers to passwords
# (Identifier -> Password). The AOP to PDF transform uses the passwords when it
# encrypts PDF documents.
#
# To modify this file for use with the sample aokpdfexit exit:
#
# 1. Copy this file to /etc/Printsrv/aokpdfexit.db.
#
# 2. List the identifiers in the first column (Identifier) and the
#    corresponding passwords in the second column (Password).
#    Identifiers and passwords can be up to 256 characters each and are
#    case sensitive.   Identifiers and passwords are terminated by:
#       - a blank (' ')
#       - a tab ('/t')
#       - a comment ('#')
#       - a newline ('\n')
#    Leading blanks and tabs are ignored.
# 	
# 3. Start comments with "#".  Anything on the line following the '#'
#    character is ignored.
#
# For information about the AOK to PDF password exit, see "IBM Print 
# Transform from AFP for Infoprint Server for z/OS, G325-2634".
#
# ========
# Details:
# ========
# The sample exit (/usr/lpp/Printsrv/lib/aokpdfexit.dll) processes this file
# line by line.  The first string in each line is interpreted as an identifier
# (either user or owner).  The second string (if one exists) is interpreted as
# a password.  The exit continues searching line by line until it finds an
# identifier (first string), which also has an associated password (second
# string), that matches either the specified pdf-user-identifier, or
# pdf-owner-identifier. If a match is found, the associated password is
# returned.   The line by line search continues until all requested passwords
# (owner, user, or both) have been determined.
#
# Anything following the password string is ignored.
