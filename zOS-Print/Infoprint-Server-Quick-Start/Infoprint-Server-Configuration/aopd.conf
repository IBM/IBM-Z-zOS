# aopd.conf - Default Infoprint Server configuration
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The aopd.conf file contains attributes that customize Infoprint
# Server.  An aopd.conf file containing the base-directory attribute
# is required.  If other attributes are missing, Infoprint Server
# uses the default values shown in the statements after the prolog.
#
# Sample configuration file is in:
#    /usr/lpp/Printsrv/samples/aopd.conf
# By default, Infoprint Server uses the configuration file in:
#    /etc/Printsrv/aopd.conf
#
# Note: PSF customers who do not purchase an Infoprint Server license
#       and want to use the Printer Inventory for PSF can specify
#       these attributes only:
#       - base-directory  (required)
#       - inventory
#
# Note: After dynamic configuration has been enabled and Infoprint 
# Server has been restarted, the attributes that are marked with 
# an asterisk are ignored and no longer used. For more information 
# about how to enable dynamic configuration, see "z/OS Infoprint 
# Server Customization."
#
#  *ascii-codepage = codepage
#                    The default ASCII code page.
#   base-directory = path
#                    The directory where Infoprint Server creates files.
#  *console-name = name
#                    The extended MCS console that Infoprint Central
#                    uses to send commands to the z/OS system.
#   dynamic-configuration = yes | no
#                    Yes means that the dynamic configuration function
#                    is enabled.
#  *ebcdic-codepage = name
#                    The default EBCDIC code page.
#   inventory = inventory
#                    The name of the Printer Inventory and the Print
#                    Interface subsystem.
#  *ipp-port-number = portnumber
#                    The number of the port at which the IPP Server
#                    listens for print requests.
#   jes-name = name  
#                    The name of the JES2 secondary subsystem that 
#                    Infoprint Server works with.  
#  *job-prefix = prefix
#                    The prefix Print Interface and NetSpool use for
#                    the job IDs that they allocate on the JES spool.
#  *log-retention = days
#                    The number of days worth of messages kept in
#                    the common message log.  IBM suggests that you
#                    specify a value greater than 0 if you run IP
#                    PrintWay extended mode because IP PrintWay
#                    extended mode writes its messages only to the
#                    common message log.
#  *lpd-port-number = portnumber
#                    The number of the port at which the Infoprint
#                    Server LPD waits for print requests.
#  *max-historical-inventory-size = megabytes
#                    The maximum size in megabytes (MBs) of the
#                    Historical Inventory.
#   resolve-printway-printers = yes | no
#                    Yes means that IP PrintWay extended mode looks up
#                    the full host names of printers in the DNS.
#  *smf-recording = yes | no
#                    Yes means that IP PrintWay extended mode writes
#                    SMF type 6 records with accounting information.
#   xcf-group-qualifier = q
#                    A qualifier that Infoprint Server adds to the 
#                    end of the XCF group name to make it unique 
#                    in a sysplex.
#   start-daemons = {[ippd] [lpd] [netd] [outd] [ssid] [subd] [xfd]}
#                    The list of Infoprint Server daemons started by the
#                    aopstart command. This attribute is ignored when the
#                    Operating mode field on the ISPF Configuration panel
#                    is set to z/OS 2.2.
#
#     ippd
#       The aopippd daemon.  This IPP Server daemon
#       processes print jobs submitted by an Internet
#       Printing Protocol (IPP) client.
#
#     lpd
#       The aoplpd daemon.  This line printer daemon processes
#       print jobs submitted with commands such as lpr, and by
#       the Infoprint Port Monitor for Windows.
#
#     netd
#       The aopnetd daemon.  This NetSpool daemon supports
#       printing from VTAM applications such as CICS and IMS.
#
#     outd
#       The aopoutd and aopwsmd daemons.  These IP
#       PrintWay extended mode daemons select output data
#       sets from the JES spool and send them to remote
#       printers or to e-mail destinations.
#
#     ssid
#       The aopssid daemon.  This Infoprint Central
#       daemon communicates between Infoprint Central and JES.
#
#     subd
#       The aopsubd daemon.  This Print Interface subsystem
#       daemon processes output data when the subsystem is
#       requested in the SUBSYS parameter on a DD statement.
#
#     xfd
#       The aopxfd daemon.  This Transform Manager daemon
#       manages some data stream transforms.
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NOTES:
# 1. Do not change base-directory or inventory while Infoprint Server  
#    (including NetSpool and IP PrintWay basic mode) is running. Also,
#    if PSF for z/OS uses the Printer Inventory, do not change these 
#    attributes while PSF is running.
# 2. If you change the inventory attribute in this file, also change the  
#    inventory name in the NetSpool, IP PrintWay basic mode, and PSF
#    started procedures.
# 3. If you change any attributes with the exception of start-daemons while 
#    Infoprint Server is running, you must stop and restart Infoprint Server 
#    before the changes take effect:
#    a) Stop IP PrintWay basic mode and the NetSpool started tasks. Also, 
#    stop PSF for z/OS if PSF uses the Printer Inventory.
#    b) Stop Infoprint Server daemons and wait for all daemons to stop. For
#    example, run the AOPSTOP procedure:
#      START AOPSTOP
#    c) Restart the Infoprint Server daemons. For example, run the AOPSTART
#    procedure:
#      START AOPSTART
#    d) Restart the IP PrintWay basic mode and NetSpool started tasks. Also,
#    restart PSF for z/OS.
# 4. If you add or remove any daemons from the start-daemons attribute, 
#    you do not need to stop any Infoprint Server daemons or other programs 
#    before restarting the daemons. When you restart the daemons, any 
#    daemons that you removed are stopped and any daemons that you
#    added are restarted.  For example, run the AOPSTART procedure:
#      START AOPSTART
#    Note: The start-daemons attribute is ignored when the Operating mode
#          field on the ISPF Configuration panel is set to z/OS 2.2.
# 5. If you use Infoprint Central and change any of the following attributes,
#    restart the z/OS HTTP Server either before or after you restart the
#    Infoprint Server daemons.
#      base-directory
#      inventory
#      jes-name
#
# For information about how to create and edit this file, and for 
# complete information about the attributes, see "z/OS Infoprint 
# Server Customization." For information about how to stop and start
# Infoprint Server, see "z/OS Infoprint Server Operation and Administration."
#
# The following statements show the default values for most of the
# attributes. Some typical values are shown for start-daemons.
# The defaults for these attributes are not shown:
#  console-name         The default depends on system attributes.
#  jes-name             The name of the JES primary subsystem.
#  xcf-group-qualifier  No qualifier.
