*      This program is an example of how to use the services of the   * 00320000
*      MVS System Logger to retrieve and delete records from the      * 00330000
*      Operations Log stream.  In response to parameters, it can  @D2A* 00340000
*      read the records created in a given time span, convert     @D2A* 00350000
*      them from Message Data Block (MDB) format to Hard-copy Log @D2A* 00360000
*      format (JES3 DLOG), mapped by DSECT DLOGLINE, and write    @TTC* 00370000
*      the DLOG-format records to a file; and/or it can delete    @TTC* 00380000
*      all the records from the stream that were created prior    @TTC* 00390000

*      It is assumed the Operations Log (Operlog) contains JES2-  @TTA* 00402000

*      COPY:  Records are to be copied to the DLOG-format file.   @TTC* 00470000
*      If COPY is not specified, no records are copied.           @D2A* 00480000

*        start_date,end_date: The starting and ending dates of    @D2A* 00500000
*          the time span, both in the format YYYYDDD.  start_date @D2A* 00510000
*          must not be later than end_date.  end_date must not be @D2A* 00520000
*          later than today, the day the program runs.  The       @D2A* 00530000
*          default for start_date is the date of the oldest       @D2A* 00540000
*          record in the log stream, and for end_date is          @D2A* 00550000
*          yesterday, the day before the program runs.  If both   @D2A* 00560000
*          start_date and end_date are allowed to default, the    @D2A* 00570000
*          parentheses after COPY may be omitted. If you          @01C* 00580000
*          specify a start date of today, you must also specify   @01A* 00590000
*          the end date of today, otherwise the program will      @01A* 00600000
*          assume an end date of yesterday and abend.             @01A* 00610000
*                                                                 @D2A* 00620000
*        >nnn: Indicates that records dated more than nnn days    @D2A* 00630000
*          before today are to be copied.  The time span will     @D2A* 00640000
*          start with the date of the oldest record in the log    @D2A* 00650000
*          stream and end nnn+1 days before today (that is,       @D2A* 00660000
*          records dated more than nnn days before today will     @D2A* 00670000
*          be copied.  nnn is a number between zero and 999.      @D2A* 00680000
*          For example, if the program is run on May 25,          @D2A* 00690000
*          specifying "COPY(>3)" will copy records dated up to    @D2A* 00700000
*          and including May 21.  Note that >0 corresponds to     @D2A* 00710000
*          yesterday.  To copy today's records, you must use the  @D2A* 00720000
*          "[start_date][,end_date]" form and specify today as    @D2A* 00730000
*          the end date.                                          @D2A* 00740000

*      DELETE:  Records are to be deleted.  If DELETE is not      @D2A* 00760000
*      specified, no records are deleted.                         @D2A* 00770000
*                                                                 @D2A* 00780000
*        date:  The date of the newest record to be deleted from  @D2A* 00790000
*          the log stream.  All records dated on or before that   @D2A* 00800000
*          date will be deleted.  The date must not be later than @D2A* 00810000
*          today.  If the date specified is today, all records in @D2A* 00820000
*          the log stream will be deleted.                        @D2A* 00830000

*        >nnn: Indicates that records dated more than nnn days    @D2A* 00850000
*          before today are to be deleted.  nnn is a number       @D2A* 00860000
*          between zero and 999.  For example, if the program is  @D2A* 00870000
*          run on July 15, specifying "DELETE(>5)" will delete    @D2A* 00880000
*          records dated up to and including July 9.  Note that   @D2A* 00890000
*          >0 corresponds to yesterday.  To delete today's        @D2A* 00900000
*          records, you must use the "date" form and specify      @D2A* 00910000
*          today as the date.                                     @D2A* 00920000

*        If DELETE is specified, either the date or ">nnn" must   @D2A* 00940000
*        be given.                                                @D2A* 00950000

*      You may specify either COPY or DELETE or both.  If you     @D2A* 00970000
*      specify both they must be separated by a comma and may     @D2A* 00980000
*      appear in either order.  However, regardless of the order  @D2A* 00990000
*      in which the parameters are specified, the copy operation  @D2A* 01000000

*      Warning:  When copying records, this program detects the   @D2A* 01150000
*      end of a day's records when it either reads the first      @D2A* 01160000
*      record for the next day or attempts to read past the       @D2A* 01170000
*      newest record in the log stream.  This means that, if      @D2A* 01180000
*      end_date is today and the log stream is being written at   @D2A* 01190000
*      the time this program runs, the records that are copied    @D2A* 01200000
*      may not be predictable.  In particular, if both COPY with  @D2A* 01210000
*      an ending date of today and DELETE with a date of today    @D2A* 01220000

*      Warning:  When the ">nnn" form of the COPY or DELETE       @D2A* 01260000

*      midnight, the records copied or deleted will not reflect   @D2A* 01330000
*      the number of days specified.  To prevent this, you should @D2A* 01340000
*      avoid running the program close to midnight with the       @D2A* 01350000

*                                                                     * 01450000
*      (1) The selection of records uses the internal timestamp of    * 01460000
*          log stream records, which corresponds to the time of the   * 01470000
*          request to write the record to the stream.  It is possible * 01480000
*          for records to be out of sequence in the log, in which     * 01490000
*          case the records ostensibly for a given day may include    * 01500000
*          some from the previous or next day.  Moreover, the         * 01510000
*          timestamp in an MDB is not necessarily the same as that of * 01520000
*          the internal log stream record.                            * 01530000
*                                                                     * 01540000
*          Therefore the selection by date is no better than an       * 01550000
*          approximation.                                             * 01560000

*          However, the set of records selected for a given day will  * 01580000
*          be unique.                                                 * 01590000
*                                                                     * 01600000
*      (2) Records could be missing based on prior                @01A* 01610000
