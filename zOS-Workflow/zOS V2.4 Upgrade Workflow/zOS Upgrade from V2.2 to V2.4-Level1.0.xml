            <p class="p">This document contains information that was
            previously presented in <cite class="cite">z/OS V2R3
            Migration</cite>, GA32-0889-30, which supports z/OS Version
            2 Release 3 (V2R3).</p>

            <h3 class="title sectiontitle">Introducing the z/OS Upgrade
            Workflow</h3>

            <p class="p">As of z/OS V2R4, IBM no longer provides <cite class="cite">z/OS Migration</cite> in a publication format.
            Since z/OS V2R2, the preferred method for learning about
            migration actions has been the z/OS Migration Workflow.
            Discovering, performing, and verifying many migration
            actions through the z/OSMF Workflows task instead of a more
            traditional book format allows for a tailored and specific
            migration path that is associated with a particular system.
            Beginning with z/OS V2R4, IBM intends to continue to
            provide migration tasks in a z/OSMF workflow, as well as a
            single exported file. By providing the z/OS V2R4 migration
            materials in both formats, users still can enjoy the
            advantages of a z/OSMF workflow and be able to search,
            browse, and print in a more traditional format.</p>

            <p class="p">Accompanying the change of format—a workflow
            instead of a book—is a change in terminology: <dfn class="term">upgrade</dfn> instead of <dfn class="term">migrate</dfn>. In our industry, the process of
            replacing software with a newer level is most often
            referred to as <dfn class="term">upgrading the
            software</dfn>. In contrast, the phrase <dfn class="term">migrating the software</dfn> can be taken to
            mean moving software from one server to another. When you
            perform the actions that are described in the workflow, you
            are upgrading z/OS to a newer level of function than the
            prior release. Thus, <dfn class="term">upgrade</dfn> is the
            appropriate term for what these workflows do.</p>

            <p class="p">With the removal of the traditional <cite class="cite">z/OS Migration</cite> publication, it is
            strongly recommended that you plan for your next upgrade by
            having z/OSMF ready to use in at least one location in your
            enterprise. Notice that the exported format of the z/OS
            upgrade materials that can be read or printed for those
            without any z/OSMF capabilities will not be tailored for
            any environment. When the z/OS migration workflow is
            provided for z/OS V2R4, it is to be renamed the <dfn class="term">z/OS Upgrade Workflow</dfn> to better identify
            that each z/OS release contains a higher level of
            functionality than the prior release. In general, the term
            <dfn class="term">upgrade</dfn> will be used in place of
            <dfn class="term">migration</dfn>.</p>

            <p class="p">The z/OS Upgrade Workflow is provided in the
            <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/IBM/IBM-Z-zOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">git repository
            for IBM/IBM-Z-zOS, which already hosts the z/OS migration
            workflows for previous releases.</p>

			<title>Typical upgrade steps</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<p>It is possible to make upgrade changes at the same time you make the changes necessary to exploit new functions in the new release. However, the more prudent approach is to do your upgrade first and then exploit new functions. The typical steps to accomplish this are:</p>  
				<ol> 
					<li>Learn about z/OS V2R4. Good sources of information include: 
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.e0za100/abstract.htm">z/OS Introduction and Release Guide</a> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.e0zb100/abstract.htm">z/OS Planning for Installation</a> 
							</li>  
							<li>The z/OS Library at 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zosInternetLibrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">z/OS Internet Library</a>.
							</li> 
						</ul> 
					</li>  
					<li>Perform as many of the upgrade actions as you can on your existing ( 
						<q>old</q>) system so that you have fewer actions to perform after you install z/OS V2R4. In this information, the actions you can perform on your existing system are identified by headings that say 
						<strong>Actions to perform before installing z/OS V2R4</strong>. Note that not all of the actions are required. Some depend on your environment, configuration, and workload, and are identified accordingly. These actions should be made to, or copied (cloned) to, all existing systems that will be migrated to z/OS z/OS V2R4. 
						<p>Use IBM Health Checker for z/OS to assist with some upgrade actions. See 
							<a class="xref" href="#mighlch">Using IBM Health Checker for z/OS for migration checking</a>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>Order and install coexistence and fallback service for any system that will share resources with a z/OS V2R4 system. (See 
						<a class="xref" href="#coxptfs">Install coexistence and fallback PTFs</a>.) This service needs to be installed on all systems that will coexist with z/OS V2R2 and all systems that will be migrated to z/OS V2R4 (and which you might fall back to).
					</li>  
					<li>Prepare the driving system. For driving system requirements, see the topic about preparing the driving system in 
						<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.e0zb100/abstract.htm">z/OS Planning for Installation</a>.
					</li>  
					<li>Order and install z/OS V2R4. If you use a ServerPac, refer to 
						<cite>ServerPac: Installing Your Order</cite>. If you use a CBPDO, see 
						<cite>z/OS Program Directory</cite> in the 
						<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zosInternetLibrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">z/OS Internet library</a>.
					</li>  
					<li>Prepare target system hardware and software. During this step, perform the upgrade actions identified by headings that say 
						<strong>Actions to perform before the first IPL of z/OS V2R4</strong>. (Again, not all of the actions are required. Some depend on your environment, configuration, and workload, and are identified accordingly.)
					</li>  
					<li>IPL the new z/OS V2R4 system with your updated customization and configuration files.</li>  
					<li>Perform any upgrade actions identified by headings that say 
						<strong>Actions to perform after the first IPL of z/OS V2R4</strong>. (Again, not all of the actions are required. Some depend on your environment, configuration, and workload, and are identified accordingly.) 
						<p>Use IBM Health Checker for z/OS to assist with some upgrade actions. See 
							<a class="xref" href="#mighlch">Using IBM Health Checker for z/OS for migration checking</a>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>Deploy z/OS V2R4 to other systems within a sysplex, data center, and enterprise. 
						<p> 
							<strong> 
								<em>The upgrade is now complete</em> 
							</strong>.
						</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>When you are confident that a system, or in some cases all systems in a sysplex, are not going to fall back to z/OS V2R3 or z/OS V2R2, you can exploit the functions introduced in z/OS V2R4.</li>  
					<li>Deploy this exploitation on other systems (again within a sysplex, data center, and eventually enterprise).</li>

			<title>Using IBM Health Checker for z/OS for migration checking</title>  
			<description><![CDATA[  
				<p>Before you upgrade to a new z/OS release, you can use IBM Health Checker for z/OS to assist with planning. Migration checks can help you determine the applicability of various upgrade actions to your current system. As with other checks provided by IBM Health Checker for z/OS, no updates are made to the system. Migration checks report only on the applicability of specific upgrade actions on a system, and only on the currently active system.</p>  
				<p>IBM Health Checker for z/OS is started automatically during system initialization.</p>  
				<p>Migration checks are similar to the other checks provided by IBM Health Checker for z/OS. The only differences are:</p>  
				<ul> 
					<li>Migration checks are inactive by default.</li>  
					<li>The names of migration checks begin with the characters 
						<strong>ZOSMIG</strong>. Following this prefix is a value to help you plan the timing of the upgrade action, as follows: 
						<dl> 
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRr_NEXT</dt>  
							<dd>Upgrade action is recommended, but will become a required upgrade action in the release after VvRr.</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRr_NEXT2</dt>  
							<dd>Upgrade action is recommended, but will become a required upgrade action two releases after VvRr.</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRr</dt>  
							<dd>Upgrade action is required in the release indicated by VvRr.</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGVvRrPREV</dt>  
							<dd>Upgrade action is required in the release indicated by VvRr and in prior releases, with the appropriate service.</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGREC</dt>  
							<dd>Upgrade action is recommended for the foreseeable future. The upgrade action might never be required.</dd>  
							<dt>ZOSMIGREQ</dt>  
							<dd>Upgrade action that is recommended now, but will be required in a future release.</dd> 
						</dl> Note: 
						<p>In previous releases, the names of migration checks followed a different set of naming conventions: one for ICSF, which used the convention 
							<strong>ICSFMIGnnnn_component_program_name</strong>, and one for the rest of z/OS, which used the convention 
							<strong>ZOSMIGVvvRrr_component_program_name</strong>.
						</p> 
					</li> 
				</ul>  
				<p>On your current z/OS release, follow these steps:</p>  
				<ol> 
					<li>Install the latest migration checks. Review all the latest health checks for both best practices and migration by using the SMP/E FIXCAT IBM.Function.HealthChecker. 
						<p>You might want to install the PTFs during a regular service window, so that an IPL is scheduled afterward. Checks are often added by a function when it is started or restarted, so you might find that installing the PTFs before a scheduled IPL works best for you. More migration checks can be added at different times, so having all the latest checks installed before making your migration plans is recommended.</p> 
					</li>  
					<li>Activate the migration checks that are appropriate to your upgrade path. Because the naming convention for migration checks indicates which release introduced the corresponding upgrade actions, you can activate only the checks that are appropriate for your upgrade path. Using SDSF (or another method for viewing checks, such as filters), you can view ahead of time which migration checks you have available on your system. For example, if you are upgrading from z/OS V2R2 to z/OS V2R4, you must activate the migration checks for changes that occurred in both z/OS V2R3 and z/OS V2R4. If you are upgrading from z/OS V2R3 to z/OS V2R4, you need to activate only the migration checks for changes that occurred in z/OS V2R4. There are many ways to make a check active, and many ways to use wild cards to include specific checks. 
						<p>Here are some examples of using the MODIFY command to make checks active:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<code>F HZSPROC,ACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,*MIG*)</code> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<code>F HZSPROC,ACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ICSFMIG*)</code> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<code>F HZSPROC,ACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ZOSMIG*)</code> 
							</li> 
						</ul> 
					</li>  
					<li>Review the migration check output and rerun checks. Any exceptions should be addressed in your migration plan. If you can complete the upgrade action before you move to the new z/OS release, you can rerun the check to verify that it was completed correctly on your current system. In some cases, the check might be available for running on the new z/OS release for verification after that release is IPLed.</li>  
					<li>Deactivate the migration checks if you want. If you no longer desire to have the migration checks active, you can deactivate them similar to the way you activated them. For example: 
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<code>F HZSPROC,DEACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,*MIG*)</code> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<code>F HZSPROC,DEACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ICSFMIG*)</code> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<code>F HZSPROC,DEACTIVATE,CHECK=(IBM*,ZOSMIG*)</code> 
							</li> 
						</ul> 
					</li> 
				</ol>  
				<p>Within this document, the upgrade actions that have checks are clearly identified within the upgrade actions.</p>  
				<p>Not all upgrade actions in this document are addressed by checks; many upgrade actions do not lend themselves to programmatic checking. Therefore, use this document to prepare your migration plan and do not rely on checks only.</p>  
				<h3>System REXX considerations</h3>  
				<p>Several IBM Health Checker for z/OS migration health checks are written in compiled System REXX. These health checks rely on System REXX customization and runtime activities being completed. If System REXX and the security environment that System REXX requires has not been properly customized, the System REXX health checks will not run successfully. Also, the compiled REXX execs must have the proper runtime support from the Alternate Library for REXX (available in z/OS since V1R9) or from IBM Library for REXX on zSeries (5695-014).</p> Note: 
				<p>To allow System REXX to use JES services, the AXRnn address spaces are started under the primary subsystem. Therefore, you must end the AXRnn address spaces before you shut down JES2. You do not have to stop the AXR address space; this action only affects the secondary AXRnn address spaces.</p>

						<p>By installing coexistence and fallback PTFs on your pre-z/OS V2R4 systems, you allow the systems to coexist with z/OS V2R4 systems during your migration. Installing coexistence and fallback PTFs also allows for fallback to the previous systems, if necessary. Coexistence and fallback are important because they allow you to migrate systems in a multisystem configuration to z/OS V2R4 using rolling IPLs (one system at a time), allowing for continuous application availability.</p>

										<p>If it is necessary to have unique IPCS data set names for your current system (because you already have the IPCS data sets with similar names on your earlier system), you can create a unique alias in your catalog that resolves to the current IPCS data sets.

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Copy files from your old system to the z/OS V2R4 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> subdirectories, and then modify the files as required for z/OS V2R4. If you have other files under your existing 
							<code>/var</code> directory, you must merge the old and new files under 
							<code>/var</code>. The easiest way to do this is to create a clone of your current 
							<code>/var</code> file system and then copy the new 
							<code>/var</code> files into the clone.
						</p>  
						<p>Many z/OS UNIX utilities are available for comparing and copying directory structures and files. Two that are especially helpful for 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> migration work are:
						</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>diff (with the 
								<strong>-r</strong> option, for recursion). This utility is useful for comparing the path structures and file contents, and has many options available. The dircmp utility has fewer options for directory comparisons, and the cmp utility stops after the first difference in a file comparison and has output that is more cumbersome.
							</li>  
							<li>pax . The 
								<strong>-rw</strong> option works like a copy (instead of making or extracting from a single file archive) for directories, symbolic links, and files. Consider the 
								<strong>-pe</strong> option for saving the attributes when doing the copy. The 
								<strong>-k</strong> option prevents overwriting of existing files. The 
								<strong>-c</strong> option causes pax to continue after encountering an error on the source file system. That is, pax prints an error message and returns a nonzero value after the command ends. Errors on the target file system (such as out of space or write errors) still cause the pax command to end as it always has.
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>To determine what you need to migrate, first compare the ServerPac 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems with your existing 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems. Mount a copy of your existing 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems to a location outside of the ServerPac file system. For instance, you might have your ServerPac file systems at 
							<code>/ServerPac/zOS_Rx/etc</code> and 
							<code>/ServerPac/zOS_Rx/var</code>, and your existing file systems at 
							<code>/Service/ImageX/etc</code> and 
							<code>/Service/ImageX/var</code>. You might have several file systems to mount that are copies of each of your image's 
							<code>/etc</code> and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems (ImageX, ImageY, and ImageZ, for instance). To compare the ServerPac and existing system's 
							<code>/etc</code> and 
							<code>/var</code>, you can run two z/OS UNIX commands, such as:
						</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>diff -r /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/etc /Service/ImageX/etc diff -r /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/var /Service/ImageX/var</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>These command results give you a list of the changes that your existing system's 
							<code>/etc</code> and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems are missing, including both the structure differences and the file content differences.
						</p>  
						<p>After you determine which directories, symbolic links, and files you are missing from your existing system, you can use one of several ways to propagate the ServerPac information forward:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>You can use the pax command (with the 
								<strong>-k</strong> option) to copy from the ServerPac 
								<code>/etc</code>, 
								<code>/global</code>, and 
								<code>/var</code> file systems to each of your existing system's 
								<code>/etc</code>, 
								<code>/global</code>, and 
								<code>/var</code> file systems. For example: 
								<pre> 
<code>cd /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/etc pax -rvwkC -pe * /Service/ImageX/etc</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Another example:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>cd /ServerPac/zOS_Rx/var pax -rvwkC -pe * /Service/ImageX/var</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>The pax command is a good choice because it copies all files, directories, and symbolic links for each file system from the ServerPac system using a single command without overlaying any existing files.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>You can rerun the product-supplied MKDIR jobs to recreate the directories and symbolic links on each of your existing system's 
								<code>/etc</code>, 
								<code>/global</code>, and 
								<code>/var</code> file systems. A list of the MKDIR jobs is found in 
								<cite>z/OS Program Directory</cite> in the 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zosInternetLibrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">z/OS Internet library</a> and the other program directories for the products that were in your ServerPac order. MKDIR jobs can be run multiple times without damaging your existing file system. For the files under 
								<code>/var/ocsf</code>, rerun the OCSF-supplied 
								<code>ocsf_install_crypto</code> installation script. Or, you can combine these jobs and script them into a single batch job to make the execution more consolidated and repeatable.
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>After you make changes to a copy of your existing image's 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems, you can unmount them and use them for your deployment of the ServerPac system, as your schedule indicates. Remember, you are using 
							<em>copies</em> of your existing 
							<code>/etc</code>, 
							<code>/global</code>, and 
							<code>/var</code> file systems, and you are 
							<em>preserving</em> what you had previously by modifying copies, so your customization for those specific existing images is not lost.

						<p>A user modification is a change that is constructed by a user to modify an existing function, add to an existing function, or add a user-defined function.</p>  
						<p>Common types of user modifications are:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>User-written and vendor-written exit routines.</li>  
							<li>User-written and vendor-written SVCs.</li>  
							<li>User-written and vendor-written termination routines.</li>  
							<li>Modifications of IBM source code.</li>  
							<li>Unit information modules (UIMs) for non-IBM hardware.</li>  
							<li>User-written and vendor-written modules that are listed in a NUCLSTxx parmlib member.</li>  
							<li>Updates to default modules to set site defaults differently than the IBM-supplied defaults, such as for the following element and features: 
								<ul> 
									<li>DFSORT. Consider using ICEPRMxx parmlib members to eliminate the assembler language installation option modules.</li>  
									<li>HLASM.</li>  
									<li>ISPF configuration table.</li>

						<p>Check with your ISVs to make sure the product levels you are using support the new z/OS release, and then reconnect your ISV products to the new release of z/OS following the instructions provided by the ISVs. If any ISV products do not need to be installed in the same libraries and zones as z/OS, place them in their own sets of libraries and SMP/E zones. This means that, unless you have to change ISV product code, such as installing PTFs, or obtain a new level of the product, you will not need to reinstall it after you install a new ServerPac.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Virtual storage requirements can increase from release to release, so it is recommended that you review the virtual storage limits that you set. Generally, there are two areas of concern: common areas (above and below the 16 MB line) and individual address spaces. An increase in virtual storage for common areas reduces the virtual storage size of all address spaces. An increase in virtual storage for individual address spaces impacts only the individual address spaces.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Determine how much virtual storage use above the 2 GB bar to allow. Though there is no practical limit to the number of virtual addresses an address space can request above the bar, the system can limit the amount of virtual storage above the bar that an address space is allowed to use. The amount of virtual storage above the bar is determined as follows. The MEMLIMIT parameter in parmlib member SMFPRMxx sets the default system-wide limit, which defaults to 2 GB as of z/OS V1R10 (and zero before z/OS V1R10). However, the system-wide default MEMLIMIT can be overridden by specifying REGION=0M or MEMLIMIT on JOB or EXEC statements in JCL.</p>  
						<p>To set a limit on the use of virtual storage above the bar, use the SMF exit IEFUSI or the parmlib member SMFLIMxx. For more information, see 
							<q>Limiting the use of memory objects</q> in 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ieaa500/abstract.htm">z/OS MVS Programming: Extended Addressability Guide</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>If you want to control the use of virtual storage above the 2 GB bar, do one or more of the following:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>The MEMLIMIT default is 2 GB. If this 2 GB default value is acceptable to you, no change to SMFPRMxx is necessary. (Before z/OS V1R10, the default MEMLIMIT was zero, and you had to specify a nonzero MEMLIMIT in an active SMFPRMxx member of parmlib to establish a system default other than zero for available virtual storage above 2 GB.)</li>  
							<li>You can specify MEMLIMIT explicitly in JCL to override the system default that was set (or allowed to default) in SMFPRMxx.</li>  
							<li>You can specify REGION=0M on the job statement in JCL to implicitly set MEMLIMIT to NOLIMIT, which also overrides the system default (from SMFPRMxx).</li>  
							<li>You can use IEFUSI or parmlib member SMFLIMxx to establish a system default MEMLIMIT for different classes of work (for example, JOB, TSO, STC) and limit the amount of virtual storage that can be used above the bar, if an explicit or implicit nonzero MEMLIMIT is in effect from JCL or SMFPRMxx. The keyword HONORIEFUSIREGION NOHONORIEFUSIREGION is available in SCHEDxx to identify if the region and MEMLIMIT settings that are specified through or otherwise affected by the IEFUSI exit are to take effect for a program. If you are overriding the attribute of HASJES20 (JES2) in SCHEDxx parmlib member, specify NOHONORIEFUSIREGION explicitly so the default of HONORIEFUSIREGION is not used for this program.</li>

					<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this upgrade action, 
						<strong>IBMRSM,RSM_MEMLIMIT</strong>. 
						<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
						<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this upgrade action requires no more activity.</p>  
						<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this upgrade action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

					<title>Accommodate new address spaces</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>The MAXUSER value in parmlib member IEASYSxx specifies a value that the system uses to limit the number of jobs and started tasks that can run concurrently during a particular IPL. You might want to increase your MAXUSER value to take new address spaces into account.</p>  
						<p>The following elements add new address spaces for z/OS V2R4:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>z/OS Container Extensions (zCX) is a new element in z/OS V2R4. It provides the runtime support to deploy and run Linux on IBM Z applications that are packaged as Docker Container images on z/OS.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The following address space is new for z/OS V2R4:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>zCX creates one address space for each provisioned server that is started by the user.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The following elements add new address spaces for z/OS V2R3:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>JES2.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The following address space is new for z/OS V2R3:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>JES2 Email Delivery Services (EDS). One new persistent address space is created by JES2 when JES2 email interfaces are used: 
								<ul> 
									<li>A job is submitted with the NOTIFY JCL statement that requests notification by an email message.</li>  
									<li>The Notify user message service (SSI 75) is called with email address as the target of a message.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>The address space is named jesxEDS, where jesx is the name of the JES2 subsystem. You must ensure that a proper user ID is assigned to the address space. This user identifier does not have to be the same as the user identifier for JES2, but you can avoid unnecessary complexity by using the same one. The user ID is specified either by adding an entry in the started procedures table (ICHRIN03) or by creating a profile in the STARTED class that matches address space name. If you prefer, both the started procedures table and STARTED class profile can be used. This action ensures that the correct user ID is assigned to the address space.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>The following address spaces existed in prior releases, but are now started automatically in z/OS V2R3 during the IPL process:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>HZR</dt>  
							<dd>Runtime Diagnostics address space</dd>  
							<dt>IZUANG1</dt>  
							<dd>IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) angel process</dd>  
							<dt>IZUSVR1</dt>  
							<dd>IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) server process</dd> 
						</dl>  
						<p>More information about the Runtime Diagnostics address space is provided in the upgrade action 
							<a class="xref" href="#RuntimeDiagMigActionV2R3">Remove commands or logic that start or restart Runtime Diagnostics</a>.
						</p>

						</table>  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>If necessary, increase your MAXUSER value in parmlib member IEASYSxx to accommodate the new address spaces. One way to determine how many address spaces you use is to enter the DISPLAY A,L command. Then, add the number of address spaces in the output messages IEE114I and IEE115I on the old and new systems to determine the total number. As of z/OS V2R3, these messages are replaced by messages CNZ4015I and CNZ4016I, respectively.</p> Note: 
						<ul> 
							<li>A modest over-specification of MAXUSER should not affect system performance.</li>  
							<li>The number of total address spaces is the sum of M/S, TS USERS, SYSAS, and INITS.</li>  
							<li>If you change the MAXUSER value, you must re-IPL to make the change effective.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Reference information</h5>

				<description><![CDATA[  
					<h4>Description</h4>  
					<p>The IBM z14™ (z14™) is designed to be the cornerstone for a trust economy. The z14 provides a scalable, highly available platform that delivers differentiated value to enable business growth, reduce cost, and protect existing investments. z/OS V2R3 enhances the role of the z14 by supporting solutions for a trusted digital economy. Capabilities that are designed to optimize high availability, performance, security, and operational flexibility can help organizations grow and secure their most critical transaction environments.</p>  
					<p>The IBM z14 family of mainframes includes the following models, which are dual frame configurations: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05. The newest addition to the IBM z14 family, the IBM z14™ Model ZR1 (z14 ZR1), is a single frame configuration. The z14 ZR1 is designed for clients who do not need the capacity of the larger M01-M05 models.</p>  
					<p>In this document, references to "z14" pertain to all models of the IBM z14, including the z14 Model ZR1, unless otherwise noted.</p>  
					<p>z/OS base support for specific z14 functions depends on the z/OS release.

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>As you plan your migration to an IBM z14™ server, consider the following items.</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Upgrade actions for IBM servers are cumulative.</strong> If you migrate to a z14 server from a z13™ or z13s server, and have performed the upgrade actions that are associated with the z13 or z13s, you have fewer upgrade actions than if you migrate from an earlier generation server. Thus, if you migrate from an earlier generation server, you might need to perform more upgrade actions. For example, if you migrate from a zEC12 server, you should read about and perform the z13 and z13s server upgrade actions in the topic 
								<a class="xref" href="#z13">Upgrade to an IBM z13 or IBM z13s server</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Support is delivered by service, z/OS features, and web deliverables.</strong> The base support for the z14 is delivered through service (PTFs). To determine which PTFs are required, get the current enhanced HOLDDATA file, either by using the SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER command or by downloading the 2-year file and using the SMP/E RECEIVE command to process it. Then, use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX report to identify the missing PTFs, if any. For example: 
								<pre> 
<code>SET BDY(GLOBAL). REPORT MISSINGFIX ZONES(target zone) FIXCAT(IBM.Device.Server.*.RequiredService).</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>If you want more granular reports for REPORT MISSINGFIX, you can use the individual FIXCATs for each server, plus the FIXCATs for any intermediate services. The FIXCATs for the z14 servers are:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>For IBM z14 models M01 through M05, the FIXCAT for z14 required service is: 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RequiredService</code>.
									</li>  
									<li>For IBM z14 Model ZR1, the FIXCAT for z14 required service is: 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RequiredService</code>.
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Exploitation of some functions requires a web deliverable. Specifically:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Exploitation of the Crypto Express6S requires the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 - z/OS V2R3 (FMID HCR77C1) web deliverable. 
										<p>If you are using this web deliverable and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the following fix category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V2R1-V2R3-HCR77C1</code> 
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express4S functionality for CCA 4.4 and other EP11 cryptographic enhancement support, which includes: RKX Key Export Wrap, UDX Reduction/simplification, additional EP11 algorithms, expanded EMV support, AP Configuration simplification, CTRACE Enhancements, and KDS Key Utilization Stats, then you must download and install the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1). 
										<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77A1 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate Fix Category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77A1</code> or 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1</code>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express5S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1). 
										<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77B0 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate fix category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B0</code> or 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1</code>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V1R13, you might need to install a Cryptographic Support web deliverable, depending on which ICSF functions you require. 
										<p>To run z/OS V1R13 on a z14 server, you require IBM Software Support Services for extended z/OS V1R13 support.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</strong> When you change the coupling facility control code level (CFLEVEL), your coupling facility structure sizes might change. If, as part of your migration to a z14 server, you change the CFLEVEL, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFLEVEL is identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CFLEVEL 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFLEVEL 22, introduced on the z14, supports the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools (GBP). This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools (LBP) and Group Buffer Pools (GBP) in data sharing environments.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the same software level throughout a sysplex.</strong> Having members of a sysplex at the same software level (other than during brief migration periods) is good software management policy.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate hardware and software at different times.</strong> To minimize the amount of change that you experience at one time, do not migrate your software release level at the same time that you migrate your hardware.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the latest version of SCRT.</strong> In z/OS V2R3, you do not need to update SCRT because it is included in the z/OS base. If you are running an earlier release of z/OS, and you use SCRT, make sure that SCRT is at the latest level. This is a requirement for sub-capacity pricing. The latest level of SCRT for releases prior to z/OS V2R3 can be downloaded from the SCRT web site at

					<title>Restrictions for a z14 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>Restrictions that are associated with the IBM z14™ server are described as follows:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Functional limitations.</strong> Not all z14 functions are available in every z/OS release. See 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14__znextfuncbc" title="This table shows a summary view of which z14 server functions are included in the base support for z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 30</a> and 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14__z14exploitation" title="This table shows a summary view of which z14 server functions can be exploited in z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 31</a> for a list of the z14 functions available in each z/OS release. Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14before">Actions you can take before you order an IBM z14 server</a> and 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14after">Actions you can take after installing an IBM z14 server</a>.) Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you plan to exploit new z14 functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the software and PTFs required for the machine and the functions you plan to exploit first, then upgrade the hardware and, finally, update your customization to exploit the new functions.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>z14 servers in a sysplex.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li>A Parallel Sysplex® that contains a z14 server either for a z/OS image or a coupling facility (CF) image can only contain other z14 servers, or z13, z13s, zEC12, or zBC12 servers. 
										<p>Note that no coupling link connectivity is possible between IBM zEC12 and IBM zBC12 systems and the IBM z14 Model ZR1. Other systems, such as the z13, z13s, and z14, can connect to the z14 Model ZR1 by using the Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR) and the Coupling Express Long Reach (CE LR) coupling links. The zEC12 and zBC12 systems do not support ICA SR or CE LR, and therefore cannot have coupling link connectivity to the z14 Model ZR1. Also, the InfiniBand coupling links are not supported on the z14 Model ZR1.</p>  
										<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a zEC12 or zBC12 server, you cannot add a z14 server to that sysplex; that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a z14 server if you have any of the earlier servers as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
										<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to zEC12, zBC12, or later to have z14 servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a z14 server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a zEC12, zBC12, or later server before introducing the z14 server.</p>  
										<p>GRS supports the use of FICON CTCs for Ring configurations. However, if you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider converting to GRS Star if possible, or using XCF signaling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signaling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>Starting with z13, servers that require time synchronization (for example, to support a base or Parallel Sysplex) must be configured in Server Time Protocol (STP) mode. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other, in a coordinated timing network (CTN). STP is a hardware feature of the z14, z13, z13s, zEC12, and zBC12. The most recent servers (z14, z13, and z13s) can participate only in an STP-only CTN. 
										<p>Starting with the z14 and the IBM Hardware Management Console (HMC) Version 2.14.0, you can use the Manage System Time task to configure an STP-only CTN. This task provides a simplified workflow for system time management, and features a visual topology display that surfaces configuration errors, if any, in the CTN.</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>HCD and HCM support for the z14.</strong> As with previous servers, hardware can be defined on any supported OS version and server. However, dynamic activation of new server and new adapter types can be done only on z14 and future high-end IBM Z® servers. 
								<p>Dynamic activation is fully supported on z/OS V2R1 and later releases. Dynamic activation is restricted on z/OS V1R13; no hardware activation is permitted, if PCIe functions or the PNETID attribute for channel paths are defined. Limited software activation is available with hardware validation support.</p>  
								<p>To run z/OS V1R13 on a z14 server, you require IBM Software Support Services for extended z/OS V1R13 support.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Environmental Record Editing and Printing (EREP) support for the z14.</strong> Starting with the PTF for APAR IO24874, EREP supports any specification for the CPU parameter. That is, EREP does not fail an unrecognized value on the CPU parameter. If no matching records are found, EREP issues warning message IFC120I, as done in previous releases.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for running an operating system in ESA/390 architecture mode.</strong> Starting with the z14, the IBM Z® servers no longer support running in ESA/390 mode. The z14 and future systems support operating systems running in z/Architecture® mode. However, all 24-bit and 31-bit problem-state application programs that were originally written to run on the ESA/390 architecture are not affected by this change.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Plan for discontinued functions.</strong> For a list of functions on the z14 that are planned to be discontinued on future servers, see 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14discontinuedfunctions">Accommodate functions for the z14 to be discontinued on future servers</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Unsupported hardware features.</strong> The following hardware features are not supported on the z14. They cannot be ordered on the z14 and cannot be carried forward from an upgrade on an earlier server to the z14. 
								<ul> 
									<li>Host Channel Adapter fanout: 
										<ul> 
											<li>The HCA2-O and HCA2-O LR features are not supported on any of the z14 models.</li>  
											<li>The HCA3-O and HCA3-O LR coupling fanouts are not supported on the z14 Model ZR1. This model requires ICA-SR and CE-LR fanouts.</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>IFB-MP Daughter Card #0326</li>  
									<li>STI-A8 Mother Card #0327</li>  
									<li>InterSystem Channel-3 (ISC-3) coupling links feature</li>  
									<li>CHPID type OSN (OSA-Express for NCP) is not supported on the OSA-Express5S GbE LX feature</li>  
									<li>OSA-Express4S features</li>  
									<li>Crypto Express4S feature</li>  
									<li>FICON Express8 features</li>  
									<li>Flash Express, which is replaced by Virtual Flash Memory on the z14</li>  
									<li>IBM zAware Firmware Appliance. IBM zAware analytics functions are now available through software, starting with IBM Operations Analytics for z Systems® Version 3.1. For more information, go to 
										<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/operations-analytics-for-z-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Operations Analytics for z Systems</a>.
									</li>  
									<li>STP Mixed CTN. The zEC12 and zBC12 were the last IBM Z® servers to support connections to an STP Mixed CTN. This also includes the Sysplex Timer (9037). Starting with the z13, servers that require Time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, require Server Time Protocol (STP) and all servers in that network must be configured in STP-only mode.</li>  
									<li>IBM zEnterprise® Application Assist Processor (zAAP). IBM continues to support running zAAP workloads on IBM z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs). IBM has removed the restriction preventing zAAP-eligible workloads from running on zIIPs when a zAAP is installed on the CEC. This change was intended to help facilitate migration and testing of zAAP workloads on zIIPs. With a z14, one CP must be installed with the installation of any zIIPs or prior to the installation of any zIIPs. The total number of zIIPs purchased cannot exceed twice the number of CPs purchased. However, for upgrades from zEC12s with zAAPs, conversions from zAAPs can increase this ratio to 4:1.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Carry forward hardware features.</strong> The following hardware features are not orderable on z14 servers. If they are installed on your existing server at the time of an upgrade to a z14 server, they can be retained or carried forward. 
								<ul> 
									<li>HMC #0092, #0094, #0095, and #0096</li>  
									<li>TKE with/4767 #0096 or #0097</li>

					<title>Actions you can take before you order an IBM z14 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>These are upgrade actions that you perform on your current system, either because they require the current system or because they are possible on the current system. You do not need the z14™ server to make these changes, and the changes do not require the z14 server once they are made. For example, discontinuing use of hardware that is no longer supported.</p>  
						<p>You can perform the following upgrade actions before you order or install a z14 server:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the Large Systems Performance Reference (LSPR).</strong> LSPR is designed to provide comprehensive z/Architecture processor capacity ratios for different configurations of central processors (CPs) across a wide variety of system control programs and workload environments.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the sysplex configuration in which the z14 server will participate.</strong> See 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14restrictions">Restrictions for a z14 server</a> for a description of the limitations when using z14 server with certain earlier servers in a Parallel Sysplex.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Implement an STP timing network.</strong> This action is needed because Sysplex Timers (9037-002) are not supported on z14 servers.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Upgrade from ISC-3 links to the Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA) links.</strong> This action is needed because ISC-3 links are not supported on z14 servers. If desired, you can take this action after you order a z14 server, as you upgrade to the new server.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Upgrade from InfiniBand coupling links, if you are ordering a z14 Model ZR1.</strong> For connectivity to other systems, the z14 ZR1 requires Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR) and the Coupling Express Long Reach (CE LR) coupling links. The z14 ZR1 does not support InfiniBand coupling links.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Upgrade from unsupported hardware features to newer technology.</strong> This action is needed because specific features are not available on the z14 server. For example, Crypto Express4S and OSA-Express4 are not supported. See 
								<a class="xref" href="#z14restrictions">Restrictions for a z14 server</a>, 
								<a class="xref" href="#at3ruio">Replace unsupported devices</a> and 
								<a class="xref" href="#au3ndv">Provide for new device installations</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Determine the level of cryptographic support you require on a z14 server.</strong> The level of function that is provided for cryptographic support differs by z/OS release and the installed ICSF web deliverable. Also, toleration PTFs are available for some cryptographic web deliverables. 
								<p>For z/OS V2R3, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R3 (FMID HCR77C0), you can use most functions of the Crypto Express6S feature on a z14 server.</li>  
									<li>ICSF Web Deliverable HCR77C1 - Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 - z/OS V2R3 provides some additional function and also incorporates enhancements that are available in PTFs for the base level of ICSF included in z/OS V2R3. The web deliverable includes support for a PCI HSM (“Payment Card Industry Hardware Security Module”) configured CCA coprocessor. Crypto Express6S also introduces the use of X.509 certificates in CCA.</li>  
									<li>If you are using this web deliverable and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the following Fix Category: 
										<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V2R1-V2R3-HCR77C1</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For z/OS V2R2, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R2 (FMID HCR77B0), you can use most functions of the Crypto Express6S feature on a z14 server.</li>  
									<li>ICSF Web Deliverable HCR77C1 - Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 – z/OS V2R3 provides some additional function and also incorporates enhancements that are available in PTFs for the base level of ICSF included in z/OS V2R2. The web deliverable includes support for a PCI HSM (“Payment Card Industry Hardware Security Module”) configured CCA coprocessor. Crypto Express6S also introduces the use of X.509 certificates in CCA.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For z/OS V2R1, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R1 (FMID HCR77A0), Crypto Express5S is tolerated on a z14 server, which treats Crypto Express5S cryptographic coprocessors and accelerators as Crypto Express4S coprocessors and accelerators. However, you must install the required PTFs identified by the SMP/E fix category: 
										<ul> 
											<li>For IBM z14 models M01 through M05, use FIXCAT value 
												<q>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RequiredService</q> 
											</li>  
											<li>For IBM z14 Model ZR1, use FIXCAT value 
												<q>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RequiredService</q> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you require support for more than 16 domains on Crypto Express5S, you must install the PTFs that are identified by the appropriate fix category for your z14 server (either 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.Exploitation</code> or 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.Exploitation</code>), or install the ICSF Web Deliverable HCR77C1 - Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 – z/OS V2R3, or a later ICSF web deliverable.
									</li>  
									<li>If you require Crypto Express4S functionality for CCA 4.4 and other EP11 cryptographic enhancement support that includes: RKX Key Export Wrap, UDX simplification, more EP11 algorithms, expanded EMV support, AP Configuration simplification, CTRACE Enhancements, and KDS Key Utilization stats, you must download and install the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable. Note: 
										<p>If you are using the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or a later ICSF web deliverable, and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs listed here, which are identified by fix category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77A1</code>, or the FIXCAT for the ICSF level that you are using.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you require Crypto Express6S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable. Note: 
										<p>If you are using ICSF Web Deliverable HCR77C1 - Cryptographic Support for z/OS V2R1 – z/OS V2R3, or a later ICSF web deliverable, and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs listed here, which are identified by fix category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B0</code>, or a later ICSF web deliverable.
										</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Install the necessary z/OS service.</strong> IBM recommends that you use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command to identify PTFs for the z14 server that you do not already have installed. The simplest way to do that is to specify 
								<code>IBM.Device.Server.*</code> and 
								<code>IBM.Function.*</code> as the fix categories for the REPORT MISSINGFIX command. Doing so will identify not only z14 support PTFs, but those for prior generations of IBM servers that you might need, and those required to enable various functions. Also, REPORT MISSINGFIX creates a batch job for the SMP/E RECEIVE ORDER command that you can use to get any PTFs you do not already have. SMP/E also provides an Explorer function that you can use to find new fix categories that might be of interest. For a description of all the fix categories, see the Values and Descriptions page at 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Fix Category Values and Descriptions</a>. For more information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.gim1000/abstract.htm">z/OS SMP/E Commands</a>. 
								<p>Here is an example of the SMP/E control statements you can use for REPORT MISSINGFIX:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>SET BDY(GLOBAL) . REPORT MISSINGFIX ZONES(target zone) FIXCAT(IBM.Device.Server.* IBM.Function.*) .</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>If you want to use specific fix categories, you can specify the following fix categories either individually or together for the z/OS PTFs that are required to use a z14 server, exploit its functions and features, and those that IBM recommends you install if you are using a z14 server. Also needed are the FIXCATs for intermediate processors.</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>For IBM z14 models M01 through M05: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RequiredService</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.Exploitation</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14-3906.RecommendedService</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>For IBM z14 Model ZR1: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RequiredService</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.Exploitation</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z14ZR1-3907.RecommendedService</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>In addition, if you choose to use specific fix categories, your environment might require that you specify one or more of these fix categories:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.DataSetEncryption</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.PricingInfrastructure</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.ServerTimeProtocol</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.UnifiedResourceManager</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.zEDC</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.zHighPerformanceFICON</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Function.zHyperLink</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If you are exploiting z14 capabilities by installing a web deliverable, additional PTFs might be required. Follow the instructions in the Program Directory that is associated with each web deliverable to identify the required PTFs.</p>  
								<p>Another way to find required PTFs is by using Preventive Service Planning (PSP) "buckets." In addition to the applicable hardware PSP buckets, you must also obtain the software PSP buckets. The hardware PSP bucket lists the recommended, required, and exploitation PTFs, and also includes information about the appropriate fix categories that are needed to identify those PTFs. However, using PSP buckets and checking on the status of the PTFs listed in them is more time-consuming and potentially error-prone than using REPORT MISSINGFIX with the appropriate fix categories.

								<strong>Run the CFSIZER tool.</strong> If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures are on a higher CFLEVEL than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes. Prepare to make the necessary changes to the CFLEVEL as indicated by the tool. 
								<p>You can download the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1027062" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Coupling Facility sizer</a>. Also, see 
									<a class="xref" href="#au3cpfl">Update your CFRM policy with coupling facility structure size changes</a>.
								</p> Note: 
								<p>After you make a coupling facility available on the new hardware, you can run the Sizer utility, an authorized z/OS program to evaluate structure size changes. The Sizer utility is distinct from CFSizer, and should be run after the new hardware (CFLEVEL) is installed, but before any CF LPAR on the new hardware is populated with structures. You can download the Sizer utility at

								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Prepare for the new machine instruction mnemonics.</strong> The instruction set has been expanded on the z14 server, as is usual for new servers. Each machine instruction is represented by a mnemonic in Assembler language. The new mnemonics can be identical to the names you chose for Assembler macro instructions. In the event of such naming collisions, the Assembler's default opcode table (UNI) processes new mnemonics as instructions, not as macros, after z14 required service has been installed. If this occurs, it is likely to cause Assembler error messages and can cause incorrect object code to be generated. If you write programs in Assembler Language, compare the names of Assembler macro instructions that are used to the new machine instructions (documented in the latest 
								<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832) to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur. Identical names cause Assembler errors or the generation of incorrect object code when you assemble your programs. For information about a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Techdocs</a>. Search for the Techdoc 
								<q>PRS5289</q>. 
								<p>If a conflict is identified, take one of these actions:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Change the name of your macro instruction.</li>  
									<li>Specify PARM='...OPTABLE(YOP)...' (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
									<li>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</li>  
									<li>Add as the first statement of your source program: *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP) (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
									<li>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</li>  
									<li>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, you can use a coding technique that permits both use of a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly such as HLASM mnemonic tags ( 
										<code>:MAC</code>  
										<code>:ASM</code>).
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Accommodate the changes to default ARCH and TUNE level.</strong> Starting with z/OS V2R3, the default ARCH level is changed from ARCH(8) to ARCH(10), and the default TUNE level is changed from TUNE(8) to TUNE(10). The new default levels align with the zEC12; thus, code can run on any server that is supported by z/OS V2R3 without requiring changes to compiler options. However, if you compile programs to be run on processors at lower architecture levels, you must specify the appropriate ARCH and TUNE levels when you compile those programs. 
								<p>The z14 supports the new levels ARCH(12) and TUNE(12), which are needed to take advantage of the new z14 instructions, and are intended to provide performance improvements for applications. ARCH(12) produces code that uses instructions that are available on the z14 in z/Architecture mode. The z14 adds instructions for vector programming, including allowing packed decimal operations to be performed in registers rather than memory. TUNE(12) generates code that is executable on all models, but is optimized for the z14.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Update I/O Configuration Program (IOCP) for earlier FICON cards.</strong> To continue using FICON Express8S cards, you must specify the new IOCP keyword MIXTYPE.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the LOADxx MACHMIG statement to help with upgrade.</strong> In the LOADxx member, you can include the new MACHMIG statement to specify particular z14 hardware facilities that you want to disable during your upgrade to another processor, z/OS release, or both. You can exclude the following z14 facilities: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Hardware-based enhanced-DAT facility (EDAT2)</li>  
									<li>Hardware-based transactional-execution facility (TX)</li>  
									<li>Hardware-based vector registers (VR) in support of SIMD (VEF)</li>  
									<li>Guarded Storage Facility (GSF).</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If you omit the MACHMIG statement, z/OS does not limit its use of the machine facilities.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Decide on the steps to take for your upgrade to a z14 server.</strong> Besides the steps that are listed here, see the following topic for guidance

								<strong>FICON Express16S.</strong> FICON Express16S supports a link data rate of 16 gigabits per second (Gbps) and auto-negotiation to 4 or 8 Gbps for synergy with existing switches, directors, and storage devices. With support for native FICON, High Performance FICON for z IBM z Systems (zHPF), and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the new FICON Express16S channel is designed to work with your existing fiber optic cabling environment. The FICON Express16S feature running at end-to-end 16 Gbps link speeds can provide reduced latency for large read/write operations, and increased bandwidth compared to the FICON Express8S feature.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Upgrade to Virtual Flash Memory (VFM).</strong> IBM Virtual Flash Memory (VFM) is the replacement for the Flash Express features (#0402, #0403) which were available on the IBM zEC12 and IBM z13. No application changes are required to change from IBM Flash Express to VFM. Ensure that you replace your Flash memory with adequate VFM.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Upgrade actions for Hardware Instrumentation Services (HIS).</strong> New diagnostic samples are added for the z14. If you want to ignore them, you might need to update your HIS profilers. Also, to tolerate the new counters (cycle and instruction) in the Problem Counter Set, you might need to update your HISSERV profilers, SMF 113 records, or z/OS UNIX System Services counter file consumers. For more information, see the topic "Starting, configuring, and stopping hardware event data collection" in 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ieag100/abstract.htm">z/OS MVS System Commands</a>. Note: 
								<p>As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available because that is where future enhancements are made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Enable BCPii communications on the support element.</strong> For Support Elements that run on z14, the setting for the “Cross Partition Authority” option is replaced by new security settings on the System Details panel and the Customize Image Profiles panel. For more information, see 
								<a class="xref" href="#zMidasBCPiiSE">Enable BCPii communications on the support element</a>.

						<p>The following changes in hardware support could affect your environment. Make the appropriate changes, as needed.</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for Host Channel Adapter fanout optical features.</strong> The z14™ is the last IBM Z® high-end server to support HCA3-O fanout (#0171) and HCA3-O LR fanout for 1x IFB (#0170). Note: 
								<p>The z14 Model ZR1 does not support the HCA3-O or the HCA3-O LR coupling fanouts. This model requires ICA-SR and CE-LR fanouts.</p>  
								<p>Enterprises should begin migrating from HCA3-O and HCA3-O LR channels to one of the following coupling links on the z14, z13, and z13s.</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>For high-speed short-range coupling connectivity, the IBM Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR). The ICA SR is a two-port, short-distance coupling fanout that uses a new coupling channel type: CS5. The ICA SR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z14, z13, and z13s servers. The ICA SR fanout requires new cabling, and can only connect to another ICA SR.</li>  
									<li>For long-range coupling connectivity, the Coupling Express Long Reach (CE LR). The CE LR is a two-port, long-distance coupling adapter that uses a new coupling channel type: CL5. The CE LR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z14, z13, and z13s servers.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>The suggested practice is to order ICA SR (#0172) or CE LR (#0433) on the z14 processors that are used in a Parallel Sysplex to help ensure coupling compatibility with future processor generations.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of FICON Express8S support.</strong> The z14 is the last IBM Z® high-end server to support FICON Express8S (#0409 and #0410) channels. Your installation should begin migrating from FICON Express8S channels to FICON Express16S+ channels(#0427 and #0428). FICON Express8S will not be supported on future high-end IBM Z® servers as carry forward on an upgrade.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for the zEDC Express.</strong> The z14 is the last IBM Z® high-end server to support the zEDC Express (#0420). In the future, IBM Z® high-end server compression acceleration functionality moves from the zEDC adapter to processors.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T adapters.</strong> The OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T adapter (#0426) is the last generation of OSA 1000BASE-T adapters to support connections operating at 100 Mb/second link speed. Future OSA-Express 1000BASE-T adapter generations will support operation only at 1000 Mb/second (1 Gb/s) link speed.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for sysplex coexistence between zEC12 and zBC12 servers and future servers.</strong>

					<h4>Description</h4>  
					<p>z/OS running on the z13 or z13s sets the groundwork for digital business by providing the foundation you need to support demanding workloads, such as operational analytics and clouds, and your traditional mission-critical applications.</p>  
					<p>In a Parallel Sysplex that includes a z13 or z13s with either a z/OS system running in at least one LPAR or at least one LPAR being used as a coupling facility (CF), you can include the following servers:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li>z13 and z13s servers</li>  
						<li>zEC12 and zBC12 servers</li>  
						<li>zEnterprise servers (z196 or z114)</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>The specific z13 and z13s functions, including base support, that are used by z/OS depend on the z/OS release. PTFs might be required for many of these functions. See 
						<a class="xref" href="#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> for information about finding the appropriate PTFs.

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>As you plan your migration to a z13 or z13s 
							<sup>TM</sup> server, consider the following:
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Relatively few upgrade actions are new when coming from an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 server.</strong> Migration to an IBM z13 or IBM z13s® server has, as its base, a migration to the IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 servers. This means that if you are migrating to a z13 or z13s server from a zEC12 or zBC12 server, and have performed the upgrade actions that are associated with the zEC12 or zBC12, you have fewer upgrade actions than if you were migrating from an earlier generation server and have not yet performed the upgrade actions that are associated with these servers. It is important to note that you can migrate directly to a z13 or z13s server without installing the intermediate servers, but you still need to ensure that any migration considerations are satisfied for the servers that you skipped. To read about the zEC12 and zBC12 server upgrade actions, see 
								<a class="xref" href="#znext21">Upgrade to an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or IBM zEnterprise BC12 server</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Support is delivered by service, z/OS features, and web deliverables.</strong> The base support for the z13 and z13s is delivered by service (PTFs). 
								<ul> 
									<li>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for the z13 server is: 
										<code>Upgrade 2964DEVICE, Subset 2964/ZOS</code> and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</code> 
									</li>  
									<li>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for the z13s server is: 
										<code>Upgrade 2965DEVICE, Subset 2965/ZOS</code> and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RequiredService</code>.
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Exploitation of some functions requires a web deliverable. Specifically:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express4S functionality for CCA 4.4 and other EP11 cryptographic enhancement support that includes: RKX Key Export Wrap, UDX Reduction/simplification, additional EP11 algorithms, expanded EMV support, AP Configuration simplification, CTRACE Enhancements, and KDS Key Utilization Stats, then you must download and install the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1). 
										<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77A1 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower-level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate Fix Category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77A1</code> or 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1</code>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require Crypto Express5S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (HCR77B1). 
										<p>If you are using either of these web deliverables (HCR77B0 or HCR77B1) and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower-level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs identified by the appropriate Fix Category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B0</code> or 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B1</code>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V2R1 and require exploitation of new hardware instructions using XL C/C++ ARCH(11) and TUNE(11) including SIMD, vector programming, MASS and ATLAS libraries, you must download and install the XL C/C++ V2R1M1 web deliverable with z13 support for z/OS 2.1.</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V1R13 and want to exploit Flash Express (including pageable 1 MB Large Page Support, optional paging of PLPA and Common (CSA, ECSA) pages to Flash Express, and Dynamic reconfiguration support for Flash Express); or 2 GB Large Page support, you must download and install the z/OS V1.13 RSM Enablement Offering Web deliverable and install the required PTFs identified by the Fix Category.</li>  
									<li>If you are running z/OS V1R13, you might need to install a Cryptographic Support web deliverable, depending on which ICSF functions you require.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</strong> When you change the coupling facility control code level (CFLEVEL), your coupling facility structure sizes might change. If, as part of your migration to a z13 server, you change the CFLEVEL, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFLEVEL is identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CFLEVEL 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFLEVEL Levels 20 and 21, introduced on the z13 and 13s, support the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools (GBP). This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to appropriately scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools (LBP) and Group Buffer Pools (GBP) in data sharing environments.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the same software level throughout a sysplex.</strong> Having members of a sysplex at the same software level (other than during brief migration periods) is good software management policy.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate hardware and software at different times.</strong> To minimize the amount of change (and therefore risk) that you experience at one time, do not migrate your software release level at the same time that you migrate your hardware.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the latest version of SCRT.</strong> In z/OS V2R3, you do not need to update SCRT because it is included in the z/OS base. If you are running an earlier release of z/OS, and you use SCRT, make sure that SCRT is at the latest level. This is a requirement for sub-capacity pricing. The latest level of SCRT for releases prior to z/OS V2R3 can be downloaded from the SCRT web site at

					<title>Restrictions for a z13 or z13s server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>Restrictions associated with the z13™ and z13s™ servers are described as follows:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Functional limitations.</strong> Not all z13 or z13s functions are available in every z/OS release. See 
								<a class="xref" href="#z13__znextfuncbc" title="This table shows a summary view of which z13 and z13s server functions are included in the base support for z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 33</a> and 
								<a class="xref" href="#z13__z13exploitation" title="This table shows a summary view of which z13 and z13s server functions can be exploited in z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 34</a> for a list of the z13 and z13s functions available in each z/OS release. Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see 
								<a class="xref" href="#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> and 
								<a class="xref" href="#znextaft21">Migration and exploitation considerations for z13 and z13s server functions</a>. ) Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you plan to exploit new z13 or z13s functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the software and PTFs required for the machine and the functions you plan to exploit first, then upgrade the hardware and, finally, update your customization to exploit the new functions.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>z13 and z13s servers in a sysplex.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li>A Parallel Sysplex that contains a z13 or z13s server either for a z/OS image or a CF image can only contain other z13 or z13s servers, or z196, z114, zEC12, or zBC12 servers. 
										<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a z196 or z114 server, you cannot add a z13 or z13s server to that sysplex; that is, you will not be able to perform rolling IPLs to introduce a z13 or z13s server if you have any of the earlier servers as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
										<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to z196, z114, or later to have z13 or z13s servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a z13 or z13s server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a z196, z114, or later server before introducing the z13 or z13s server.</p>  
										<p>GRS supports the use of FICON CTCs for Ring configurations. However, if you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider converting to GRS Star if possible, or using XCF signalling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signalling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>InterSystem Channel 3 (ISC-3) and Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4) Coupling Links are not supported on z13 or z13s CPC. Instead, the IBM Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR), introduced on the z13 and z13s, is a two-port, short distance coupling fanout that utilizes a new coupling channel type: CS5. The ICA SR can only be used for coupling connectivity between z13 or z13s servers, and the ICA SR can only connect to another ICA SR. IBM recommends that you order ICA SR (#0172) on the z13 processors used in a Parallel Sysplex to help ensure coupling compatibility with future processor generations. You can also use 12x InfiniBand coupling links, which are designed to replace Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4), and to complement 1x InfiniBand and ISC-3 on a z13 or z13s server. InfiniBand coupling can provide significantly improved service times compared to ISC-3s for distances up to 150 meters. You can read about coupling links in
										<em>IBM System z® Connectivity Handbook</em> (SG24-5444).
									</li>  
									<li>The z13 or z13s server cannot be connected to a Sysplex Timer (9037-002). The Server Time Protocol (STP) feature is the follow-on to the Sysplex Timer. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other without requiring a Sysplex Timer. STP is a hardware feature of the z13, z13s, zEC12, zBC12, z196, and z114. For more information about how to implement STP, see the 
										<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/pso/stp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Server Time Protocol (STP) website</a>. 
										<p>The STP design introduced a concept called Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). A CTN is a collection of servers and coupling facilities that are time-synchronized to a time value called Coordinated Server Time. A CTN can be configured in two ways:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>STP-only CTN, which does not require a Sysplex Timer. A z13 or z13s must participate in an STP-only CTN.</li>  
											<li>Mixed-CTN (External Time Reference and STP), which does require a Sysplex Timer. zEC12 and zBC12 were the last servers to support mixed-CTN. The z13 and z13s do not support connections to a Mixed-CTN. All servers in the network must be configured in STP-only mode. Consider migrating servers that require time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, to the Server Time Protocol (STP).</li>

								<strong>Plan for discontinued functions.</strong> For a list of functions on the z13 server that are planned to be discontinued on future servers, see 
								<a class="xref" href="#z132012hw1">Accommodate functions for the z13 server or z13s to be discontinued on future servers</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Unsupported hardware features.</strong> The following hardware features cannot be ordered and cannot be carried forward from an upgrade on an earlier server to the z13 server. 
								<ul> 
									<li>HCA2-O</li>  
									<li>HCA2-O LR</li>  
									<li>ISC-3 links</li>  
									<li>CHPID type OSN (OSA-Express for NCP) is not supported on the OSA-Express5S GbE LX feature</li>  
									<li>Crypto Express3 (#0864)</li>  
									<li>Crypto Express4S (#0865)</li>  
									<li>STP Mixed CTN. The zEC12 and zBC12 were the last IBM Z® servers to support connections to an STP Mixed CTN. This also includes the Sysplex Timer (9037). Starting with z13, servers that require Time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, will require Server Time Protocol (STP) and all servers in that network must be configured in STP-only mode.</li>  
									<li>IBM zEnterprise Application Assist Processor (zAAP). IBM continues to support running zAAP workloads on IBM z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs). IBM has removed the restriction preventing zAAP-eligible workloads from running on zIIPs when a zAAP is installed on the CEC. This change was intended to help facilitate migration and testing of zAAP workloads on zIIPs. With a z13, one CP must be installed with the installation of any zIIPs or prior to the installation of any zIIPs. The total number of zIIPs purchased cannot exceed twice the number of CPs purchased. However, for upgrades from zEC12s with zAAPs, conversions from zAAPs may increase this ratio to 4:1.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Carry forward hardware features.</strong> The following hardware features are not orderable on z13 servers. If they are installed on your existing server at the time of an upgrade to a z13 server, they can be retained or carried forward.

					<title>Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>You can perform the following upgrade actions before you order or install a z13 or z13s 
							<sup>TM</sup> server:
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Review the sysplex configuration in which the z13 or z13s server will participate. See 
								<a class="xref" href="#z13res21">Restrictions for a z13 or z13s server</a> for a description of the limitations when using z13 or z13s servers with certain earlier servers in a Parallel Sysplex.
							</li>  
							<li>Implement an STP timing network. This action is needed because Sysplex Timers (9037-002) are not supported on z13 or z13s servers.</li>  
							<li>Migrate from ISC-3 links to Infinband or Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA) links. This action is needed because ISC-3 links are not supported on z13 or z13s servers. If desired, you can take this action after you order a z13 or z13s server, as you upgrade to the new server.</li>  
							<li>Migrate from unsupported hardware features to newer technology. This action is needed because ESCON, FICON Express4, Crypto Express3, and OSA-Express3 are not supported on z13 or z13s servers. See 
								<a class="xref" href="#z13res21">Restrictions for a z13 or z13s server</a>, 
								<a class="xref" href="#at3ruio">Replace unsupported devices</a>, and 
								<a class="xref" href="#au3ndv">Provide for new device installations</a>.
							</li>  
							<li>Determine the level of cryptographic support you require on a z13 or z13s server. The level of function provided for cryptographic support differs by z/OS release and the installed ICSF web deliverable. Also, toleration PTFs are available for some cryptographic web deliverables. 
								<p>For z/OS V2R3, if you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R3, you can use all functions of the Crypto Express5 feature on a z13 or z13s server.</p>  
								<p>For z/OS V2R2, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R2, you can use the most functions of the Crypto Express5 feature on a z13 or z13s server.</li>  
									<li>The Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13 - z/OS V2R2 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B1) provides some additional function and also incorporates enhancements that are available in PTFs for the base level of ICSF included in z/OS V2R1. The web deliverable includes new operator commands with Parallel Sysplex wide scope that can be used to perform certain cryptographic administrative functions. These functions include activating, deactivating, and restarting cryptographic coprocessors. This support can also be used to display status for available cryptographic devices and information about active key data sets (KDSs).</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For z/OS V2R1, consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are using the level of ICSF that is shipped as part of z/OS V2R1, you can tolerate Crypto Express5 on a z13 or z13s server, which treats Crypto Express5S cryptographic coprocessors and accelerators as Crypto Express4S coprocessors and accelerators. However, you must install the required PTFs identified by the SMP/E fix category: 
										<ul> 
											<li>For the z13: 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</code> 
											</li>  
											<li>For the z13s: 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RequiredService</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you require support for greater than 16 domains (up to 85) on Crypto Express5S, you must install the PTFs that are identified by the appropriate fix category 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.Exploitation</code> or 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.Exploitation</code>, or install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable.
									</li>  
									<li>If you require Crypto Express4S functionality for CCA 4.4 and other EP11 cryptographic enhancement support that includes: RKX Key Export Wrap, UDX simplification, additional EP11 algorithms, expanded EMV support, AP Configuration simplification, CTRACE Enhancements, and KDS Key Utilization stats, you must download and install the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable. Note: 
										<p>If you are using the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) or a later ICSF web deliverable, and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs listed here, which are identified by fix category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77A1</code>, or the FIXCAT for the ICSF level that you are using.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you require Crypto Express5S exploitation support for the next Generation Coprocessor support or VISA Format Preserving Encryption (FPE), you must download and install the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 web deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable. Note: 
										<p>If you are using the Enhanced Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 Web Deliverable (FMID HCR77B0) or a later ICSF web deliverable, and sharing keys with other z/OS systems that have a lower level of ICSF, you require the coexistence PTFs listed here, which are identified by fix category: 
											<code>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-z/OS_V2R1-HCR77B0</code>, or a later ICSF web deliverable.
										</p> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets. You must obtain all of the appropriate Preventive Service Planning (PSP) buckets. In addition to the hardware PSP buckets, you must also obtain the software PSP buckets. Use the Fix Categories that are specified in the associated FIXCAT HOLDDATA to identify PTFs required for the z13 server, PTFs needed to exploit z13 capabilities, and PTFs recommended to fix known problems. Specifically, fixes in the following categories: 
								<ul> 
									<li>For the z13: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RequiredService</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.Exploitation</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.RecommendedService</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>For the z13s: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RequiredService</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.Exploitation</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.RecommendedService</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Fixes required for several zEnterprise functions (such as Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand Coupling Links, Server Time Protocol (STP), the Unified Resource Manager, High Performance FICON for IBM z Systems (zHPF), and zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) are not listed in the hardware PSP bucket, but can be found by using the following Fix Categories:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>For the z13: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.ServerTimeProtocol</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.UnifiedResourceManager</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13-2964.zHighPerformanceFICON</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Function.zEDC</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>For the z13s: 
										<ul> 
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.ServerTimeProtocol</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.UnifiedResourceManager</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Device.Server.z13S-2965.zHighPerformanceFICON</code> 
											</li>  
											<li> 
												<code>IBM.Function.zEDC</code> 
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Because the PTFs associated with these Fix Categories are not specific to a z13 server, you should consider specifying a generic wildcard for the server to ensure that you have all the appropriate service installed. For example:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.*.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.*.ServerTimeProtocol</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.*.UnifiedResourceManager</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.*.zHighPerformanceFICON</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Similarly, fixes needed for zBX or to support the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) are not listed in the hardware PSP bucket, but can be found by using the following Fix Categories:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.zBX-2458</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>IBM.DB2.AnalyticsAccelerator.*</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If you are exploiting z13 capabilities by installing a web deliverable, you must install the PTFs listed in the software PSP buckets for each of the web deliverables that you are installing. See the program directory for the web deliverable to identify the required software PSP buckets.</p>  
								<p>The REPORT MISSINGFIX command checks your GLOBAL zone for FIXCAT HOLDDATA matching the FIXCAT values specified on the command. The command then compares the APARs identified in that FIXCAT HOLDDATA with the PTFs installed in the specified zones, and produces a report to identify any APARs not resolved. In other words, it reports which PTFs (fixes) are missing for the specified fix categories. Furthermore, the command produces a customized job that is used to obtain any PTFs not already received through the RECEIVE ORDER command, and install any missing service via the APPLY CHECK command.</p>  
								<p>The FIXCAT operand on the REPORT MISSINGFIX command can list multiple fix categories, as well as using the same wildcarding techniques described in this topic for the SOURCEID operand. Because both of these techniques are simple and integrated into basic SMP/E commands, use them periodically to ensure the latest PTFs specified in the hardware and software PSP buckets are installed (because PSP buckets can be updated daily). SMP/E also provides an Explorer function which helps in identifying new fix categories which might be of interest. For a description of all the fix categories, see the Values and Descriptions page at 
									<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/smpe/fix-category.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Fix Category Values and Descriptions</a>. For more information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see

								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Run the CFSIZER tool. If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures are on a higher CFLEVEL than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes. Prepare to make the necessary changes to the CFLEVEL as indicated by the tool. 
								<p>You can download the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1027062" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Coupling Facility sizer</a>. Also, see 
									<a class="xref" href="#au3cpfl">Update your CFRM policy with coupling facility structure size changes</a>.
								</p> Note: 
								<p>After you make a coupling facility available on the new hardware, you can run the Sizer utility, an authorized z/OS program, to evaluate structure size changes. The Sizer utility is distinct from CFSizer, and should be run after the new hardware (CFLEVEL) is installed, but before any CF LPAR on the new hardware is populated with structures. You can download the Sizer utility at 
									<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1025939" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">CFSizer Alternate Sizing Techniques</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Prepare for the new machine instruction mnemonics. In support of the z13 server, there are new machine instructions. The new machine instructions (mnemonics) can collide with (be identical to) the names of Assembler macro instructions you use. In the event of such collisions, the Assembler default opcode table (UNI) treats specification of these names as instructions when the z13 required service is installed, probably causing Assembler error messages and possibly causing generation of incorrect object code. If you write programs in Assembler Language, compare the names of Assembler macro instructions that are used to the new machine instructions (documented in the latest 
								<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832) to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur. Identical names cause Assembler errors or the generation of incorrect object code when you assemble your programs. For information about a tool to help in identifying mnemonic conflicts, see 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Techdocs</a>. Search for the Techdoc 
								<q>PRS5289</q>. 
								<p>If a conflict is identified, take one of these actions:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Change the name of your macro instruction.</li>  
									<li>Specify PARM='...OPTABLE(YOP)...' (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
									<li>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</li>  
									<li>Add as the first statement of your source program: *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP) (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
									<li>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</li>  
									<li>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, you can use a coding technique that permits both use of a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly such as HLASM mnemonic tags (:MAC :ASM).</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Decide on the steps to take for your migration to a z13 server. Besides the steps listed here, see the following topic for guidance

						<p>The following z13 and z13s 
							<sup>TM</sup> functions have considerations when you are planning for migration and exploitation. For PTF information, see the notes for 
							<a class="xref" href="#z13__znextfuncbc" title="This table shows a summary view of which z13 and z13s server functions are included in the base support for z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 33</a>.
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Large Systems Performance Reference (LSPR) method.</strong> LSPR is designed to provide comprehensive z/Architecture processor capacity ratios for different configurations of central processors (CPs) across a wide variety of system control programs and workload environments.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT).</strong> Incremental throughput is achieved partly because the new processor chip offers intelligently implemented 2-way simultaneous multithreading. Simultaneous multithreading allows two active instruction streams per core, each dynamically sharing the core's execution resources. SMT is available on the z13 for workloads that are running on the Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and the IBM z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP).
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>CFLEVEL 20 and CFLEVEL 21 support.</strong> CFLEVEL 20 and 21 support the Coupling Facility use of Large Memory to improve availability for larger CF cache structures and data sharing performance with larger DB2 Group Buffer Pools. This support removes inhibitors to using large CF cache structures, enabling use of Large Memory to scale to larger DB2 Local Buffer Pools and Group Buffer Pools in data sharing environments.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Coupling links.</strong> IBM z13 introduced new PCIe (Integrated Coupling Adapter ICA SR) based Short Reach coupling links using a new CHPID type, CS5. ICA-SR links can only connect z13 and z13s CPCs to other z13 and z13s CPCs. 
								<p>IBM z13 and z13s CPC now support up to 256 links. A single z/OS or a CF Image supports a maximum of 128 links. When displaying STP (DISPLAY ETR) from a z/OS image, information is provided for the entire CPC. If more than 128 links are defined, the z/OS support must be installed on all z/OS releases running on that CPC, so that information about more than 128 links, including STP timing information, can be displayed.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>SIMD.</strong> z/OS V2R1 (and later) is designed to support the new vector extension facility (Single Instruction Multiple Data, SIMD) instructions available on IBM z13 servers. SIMD provides a powerful framework for development of new Business Analytics workloads, porting math-intensive workloads from other platforms, and accelerating Business Analytics workloads on IBM z13 and z13s servers. High Data Intensity, High Computational Intensity, Predictive IT Analytics, Advanced Security/Crypto, BI Reporting, Perspective Analytics, and Next-Generation Data Warehousing are some of the workloads that may benefit from Data Parallelism (SIMD). z/OS support includes enablement of Vector Registers (VR) on IBM z13 and z13s servers, Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem (MASS), and Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS) support, as well as Language Environment enablement for C runtime functions.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Cryptographic Enhancements.</strong> Cryptographic enhancements for z/OS V2R1 (and later) on z13 servers include: 
								<ul> 
									<li>VISA Format Preserving Encryption (VFPE). Support for VFPE algorithms in CCA-based callable services helps legacy databases to contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications. This support relies on the Crypto Express5S coprocessor.</li>  
									<li>Greater than 16 Domain support. This support allows a cryptographic coprocessor to be shared across more than 16 domains, up to the maximum number of LPARs on the system. This support relies on enhanced firmware available with a minimum microcode level for the Crypto Express5S coprocessor.</li>  
									<li>Trusted Key Entry (TKE) 8.0 Licensed Internal Code (LIC). This support includes Crypto Express5S Coprocessor support, FIPS Certified Smart Card, Crypto Coprocessors with more than 16 domains, a full-function migration wizard for EP11 coprocessors, new master key management functions, a Smart Card Readers Available indicator, a Configure Displayed Hash Size utility, ECC Authority Signature Keys, print capability, new features in the Crypto Node Management (CNM) utility, ENC-Zero verification pattern for 24-byte DES operational keys, and usability enhancements.</li> 
								</ul>

									<a class="xref" href="#z13bef21">Actions you can take before you order a z13 or z13s server</a> 
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>IBM zAware system.</strong> The IBM zAware feature is designed to offer a near real-time, continuous learning, and diagnostics capability intended to help you pinpoint and resolve potential problems quickly enough to minimize impacts to your business. The new version of IBM zAware introduces a new generation of technology with improved analytics to provide better results. After you order a z13 or z13s server, you can prepare to set up an IBM zAware environment by defining the IBM zAware logical partition (LPAR), defining and using OPERLOG log streams, and network definitions to connect the z/OS LPAR to the IBM zAware LPAR. For more information, see 
								<cite>IBM z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter (IBM zAware) Guide</cite>, (SC27-2623), and 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ieaf100/abstract.htm">z/OS MVS Setting Up a Sysplex</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Java exploitation.</strong> This support is added by: 
								<ul> 
									<li>IBM 31-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 (5655-DGG)</li>  
									<li>IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 (5655-DGH)</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Flash Express.</strong> With this support, z/OS is designed to help improve system availability and responsiveness by using Flash Express across transitional workload events such as market openings, and diagnostic data collection. z/OS is also designed to help improve processor performance by supporting middleware exploitation of pageable large (1 MB) pages. This support requires the Flash Express hardware feature.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>2GB Large Page support.</strong> This support includes support for 2 GB large fixed pages.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>New z/Architecture instructions: XL C/C++ ARCH(11) and TUNE(11) parameters.</strong> This function provides new hardware instruction support, including support for the vector facility, the decimal floating point packed conversion facility, and numerous performance improvements (machine model scheduling and code generation updates). Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction set and execution support is provided through the new vector support in the compiler, including Business Analytics vector processing through the MASS and ATLAS libraries. Unlike prior generations of servers, to use any of these functions on z/OS V2R1, you must download and install the XL C/C++ V2R1M1 web deliverable with z13 support for z/OS 2.1.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>FICON Express16S.</strong> FICON Express16S supports a link data rate of 16 gigabits per second (GBPS) and auto-negotiation to 4 or 8 GBPS for synergy with existing switches, directors, and storage devices. With support for native FICON, High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF), and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the new FICON Express16S channel is designed to work with your existing fiber optic cabling environment. The FICON Express16S feature running at end-to-end 16 GBPS link speeds provides reduced latency for large read/write operations, and increased bandwidth compared to the FICON Express8S feature.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>FICON Dynamic Routing.</strong> With z13, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static Storage Area Network (SAN) routing policies for Inter-Switch Links (ISLs) for cascaded FICON directors. You need to ensure that all devices in your FICON SAN support FICON Dynamic Routing before implementing this feature.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Improved High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF) I/O Execution at Distance.</strong> High Performance FICON for System z (zHPF) has been enhanced to allow all large write operations (&gt; 64 KB) at distances up to 100 km to be executed in a single return trip to the control unit, thereby not elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Improved Channel Subsystem (CSS) Scalability.</strong> The IBM Z® servers have improved the channel subsystem (CSS) scalability, as follows: 
								<ul> 
									<li>The z13 server improves CSS scalability with support for six logical channel subsystems (LCSSs), which are required to support the 85 LPARs for z13, four subchannel sets (to support more devices per logical channel subsystem), and 32K devices per FICON channel, up from 24K channels in the previous generation. Additionally, a fourth subchannel set for each LCSS is provided to facilitate elimination of single points of failure for storage after a disk failure.</li>  
									<li>The z13s server improves CSS scalability with support for three logical channel subsystems (LCSSs) which are required to support the 40 LPARs for IBM z13s, three subchannel sets (to support more devices per logical channel subsystem), and 32K devices per FICON channel up from 24K channels in the previous generation. Additionally, a third subchannel set for each logical channel subsystem (LCSS) is provided to facilitate elimination of single points of failure for disk storage devices.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>PCIe and HCD Definitions.</strong> z/OS V2R1, and z/OS V2R1 HCD (FMID HCS7790) support full exploitation for z13 and z13s processors (types 2964 and 2965) with support for up to 6 channel subsystems and 4 subchannel sets. To support PCIe functions for systems that are running on zEC12, zBC12, z13, or z13s servers, HCD introduced a new dialog for defining PCIe functions and assigning the functions to LPARs. 
								<p>IBM recommends that you define and activate all the new hardware definitions on a z/OS V2R2 system, or on a V2R1 system with the appropriate HCD PTF (APAR OA44294) installed and perform software activations (with hardware validation) only on lower-level systems.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Consider the changes in the CPU Measurement Facility counters.</strong> The number of CPU measurement facility counters for z13 and z13s servers remains at 128. Though the structure of the SMF 113 record does not change, the values, interpretations, and frequency of certain sections do change; therefore, current tools that use the data must be updated for the z13 and z13s servers. 
								<p>For example, consider the following SMF record field:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>SMF113_2_CtrVN2 identifies how to interpret the MT-Diagnostic, Crypto, and Extended Counter Sets. As described in 
										<cite>The IBM CPU Measurement Facility Extended Counters Definition for z10 and z196</cite>, SA23-2260, this field is set to 1 (for z10), 2 (for z196 or z114), 3 (for zEC12 and zBC12), or 4 (for z13 and z13s).
									</li> 
								</ul> Note: 
								<p>As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available because that is where future enhancements are made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>The following changes in hardware support could affect your environment. Make the appropriate changes, as needed.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for running an operating system in ESA/390 architecture mode.</strong> The z13 and z13s™ are the last IBM Z® servers to support running in ESA/390 mode. All future systems will support only operating systems running in z/Architecture mode. However, all 24-bit and 31-bit problem-state application programs originally written to run on the ESA/390 architecture will be unaffected by this change.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for Classic Style User Interface on the Hardware Management Console and Support Element.</strong> The z13 and z13s are the last IBM Z® servers to support Classic Style User Interface. In the future, user interface enhancements will be focused on the Tree Style User Interface.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for the Hardware Management Console Common Infrastructure Model (CIM) Management Interface.</strong> The z13 and z13s are the last IBM Z® servers to support the Hardware Console Common Infrastructure module (CIM) Management Interface. The Hardware Management Console Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and Web Services Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will continue to be supported.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of FICON Express8 support.</strong> The z13 and z13s are the last IBM Z® servers to support FICON Express8. You should begin migrating from FICON Express8 channel features (#3325, #3326) to FICON Express16S channel features (#0418, #0419). FICON Express8 will not be supported on future high-end IBM Z® servers as carry forward on an upgrade.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for ordering FICON Express8S channel features.</strong> Enterprises that have 2GB device connectivity requirements must carry forward these channels.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of an option for the way shared logical processors are managed under PR/SM LPAR.</strong> The z13 and z13s are the last IBM Z® servers to support selection of the option 
								<q>Do not end the timeslice if a partition enters a wait state</q> when the option to set a processor run-time value has been previously selected in the CPC RESET profile. The CPC RESET profile applies to all shared logical partitions on the machine, and is not selectable by logical partition.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for configuring OSN CHPID types.</strong> OSN CHPIDs are used to communicate between an operating system instance running in one logical partition and the Communications Controller for Linux (CCL) product in another logical partition on the same CPC. See announcement letter #914-227 dated 12/02/2014 for details regarding withdrawal from marketing for the CCL product.

					<title>General recommendations and considerations for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>As you plan your migration to a zEnterprise server, consider the following:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Relatively few upgrade actions are new when coming from a z196 or z114 server.</strong> Migration to an IBM zEnterprise EC12 or zEnterprise BC12 server has, as its base, a migration to the z196 or z114 servers. This means that if you are migrating to a zEnterprise server from a z196 or z114 server, and have performed the upgrade actions that are associated with the z196 or z114, you have fewer upgrade actions than if you were migrating from an earlier generation server and have not yet performed the upgrade actions that are associated with these servers. It is important to note that you can migrate directly to a zEC12 or zBC12 server without installing the intermediate servers, but you still need to ensure that any migration considerations are satisfied for the servers that you skipped.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Support is delivered by service, z/OS features, and web deliverables.</strong> The base support for an zEC12 or zBC12 server is delivered by service (PTFs). 
								<ul> 
									<li>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for zBC12 is: 
										<code>Upgrade 2828DEVICE, Subset 2828/ZOS</code> and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category 
										<code>IBM.Device.Server.zBC12-2828</code>.
									</li>  
									<li>The PSP bucket that contains the required list of PTFs for zEC12 is: 
										<code>Upgrade 2827DEVICE, Subset 2827/ZOS</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>and is identified by the following SMP/E Fix Category 
									<code>IBM.Device.Server.zEC12-2827</code>.
								</p>  
								<p>For Flash Express support (including dynamic reconfiguration support and optional PLPA/COMMON page data set support), pageable 1 MB Large Page support, and 2 GB Large Page Support, a separate web deliverable for z/OS V1R13 (the z/OS V1R13 RSM Enablement Offering web deliverable) is required. (See 
									<q>Decide on the steps you will take for your migration to a zEC12 or zBC12 server</q> in 
									<a class="xref" href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> for further information.)
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Larger coupling facility structure sizes might be necessary.</strong> When you change the coupling facility control code level (CFLEVEL), your coupling facility structure sizes might change. zEC12 servers that were ordered before September 2013 initially shipped with CFLEVEL 18, zEC12 or zBC12 models ordered after September 2013 initially shipped with CFLEVEL 19. If, as part of your migration to a zEC12 or zBC12 server, you change the CFLEVEL, you might have larger structure sizes than you did previously. If your CFLEVEL is identical, structure sizes are not expected to change when you migrate from a previous server to a newer generation server. In addition, similar to CFLEVEL 17 and later, ensure that the CF LPAR has at least 512MB of storage. CFLEVEL 19 introduces support for storage-class (flash) memory in the CF and Coupling thin interrupt support. CF structures that exploit SCM might require significantly more CF real storage than they did before storage class memory exploitation.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the same software level throughout a sysplex.</strong> Having members of a sysplex at the same software level (other than during brief migration periods) is good software management policy.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate hardware and software at different times.</strong> To minimize the amount of change (and therefore risk) that you experience at one time, do not migrate your software release level at the same time that you migrate your hardware.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Use the latest version of SCRT.</strong> In z/OS V2R3, you do not need to update SCRT because it is included in the z/OS base. If you are running an earlier release of z/OS, and you use SCRT, make sure that SCRT is at the latest level. This is a requirement for sub-capacity pricing. The latest level of SCRT for releases prior to z/OS V2R3 can be downloaded from the SCRT web site at

					<title>Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>The following restrictions are associated with zEnterprise servers:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Functional limitations.</strong> Not all zEC12 or zBC12 functions are available in every z/OS release. See the following topics for the zEC12 and zBC12 functions that are available in each z/OS release: 
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<a class="xref" href="#znext21__znextfuncbc" title="This table shows a summary view of which zEC12 and zBC12 server functions are included in the base support for z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 36</a> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<a class="xref" href="#znext21__znextbcexp1" title="This table shows a summary view of which zEC12 and zBC12 server functions can be exploited in z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 37</a> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Some functions have migration or exploitation considerations (see 
									<a class="xref" href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> and 
									<a class="xref" href="#znextaft21a">Migration and exploitation considerations for zEC12 and zBC12 server functions</a>. ) Many functions are enabled or disabled, based on the presence or absence of the required hardware and software. If you wish to position yourself to exploit any new zEC12 or zBC12 functions, you can install the software and hardware in either order; that is, there is no requirement to install either software or hardware first to exploit a specific function. However, because of outage windows and testing considerations, you might want to consider installing all the required software first, then upgrading the hardware and, finally, updating your customization to exploit the new functions.

									<li>A Parallel Sysplex that contains an zEC12 or zBC12 server either for a z/OS image or a CF image can contain only zEC12 or zBC12 servers or zEnterprise z196, z114, z10 EC, or z10 BC servers. 
										<p>If you are running z/OS on any servers earlier than a z10 EC or z10 BC server, you cannot add a zEC12 or zBC12 server to that sysplex; that is, you cannot perform rolling IPLs to introduce a zEC12 or zBC12 server if you have any of the earlier servers either as z/OS images or coupling facility images in the sysplex.</p>  
										<p>The earlier servers in the sysplex must be upgraded to System z10 or later to have zEC12 or zBC12 servers supported in the sysplex. If you have any z/OS images or coupling facility images on an earlier server, and you intend to introduce a zEC12 or zBC12 server into that sysplex, you must migrate those images to a System z10 (or later) server before introducing the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</p>  
										<p>If you are currently using ESCON CTCs for GRS ring configurations within a sysplex, consider using XCF signaling in a GRS ring configuration. XCF sysplex signaling is preferred instead of GRS CTC connections.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>The Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4) Coupling Links are not supported on a zEC12 or zBC12 CPC. Use 12x InfiniBand coupling links, which are designed to replace Integrated Cluster Bus 4 (ICB-4), and to complement 1x InfiniBand and ISC-3 on a zEC12 or zBC12 server. InfiniBand coupling can provide significantly improved service times compared to ISC-3s for distances up to 150 meters. You can read about InfiniBand coupling links in 
										<em>IBM System z Connectivity Handbook</em> (SG24-5444).
									</li>  
									<li>The zEC12 or zBC12 server cannot be connected to a Sysplex Timer (9037-002). The Server Time Protocol (STP) feature is the follow-on to the Sysplex Timer. STP is designed to allow multiple servers and coupling facilities to maintain time synchronization with each other without requiring a Sysplex Timer. STP is a hardware feature of the zEC12, zBC12, z196, z114, z10 EC, and z10 BC. For more information about how to implement STP, see the 
										<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/pso/stp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Server Time Protocol (STP) website</a>. 
										<p>The STP design introduced a concept that is called Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). A CTN is a collection of servers and coupling facilities that are time-synchronized to a time value called Coordinated Server Time. A CTN can be configured in two ways:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>STP-only CTN, which does not require a Sysplex Timer.</li>  
											<li>Mixed-CTN (External Time Reference and STP), which does require a Sysplex Timer. 
												<p>The Sysplex Timer provides the timekeeping information in a Mixed-CTN. Even though the zEC12 or zBC12 servers do not support attachment to a Sysplex Timer, they can participate in a Mixed-CTN with a z10 server that is synchronized to the Sysplex Timer. This maintains the capability for enterprises to concurrently migrate from an existing External Time Reference (ETR) to a Mixed-CTN and from a Mixed-CTN to an STP-only CTN.</p> 
											</li> 
										</ul> Note: 
										<p>The zEC12 and zBC12 are the last high-end servers to support connections to an STP Mixed-CTN. All servers in the network must be configured in STP-only mode. Consider migrating servers that require time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, to the Server Time Protocol (STP).</p>

							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Unsupported hardware features.</strong> The following hardware features cannot be ordered and cannot be carried forward from an upgrade on an earlier server to the zEC12 or zBC12 server. 
								<ul> 
									<li>Power® Sequence Controller (PSC).</li>  
									<li>FICON Express. Your installation should begin migrating to FICON Express8S channels.</li>

									<li>Dial up modems. The currently available Network Time Protocol (NTP) server option for ETS, as well as Internet time services available using broadband connections, can be used to provide the same degree of accuracy as dial-up time services. You should begin migrating from dial-up modems to broadband for RSF connections.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<strong>Carry forward hardware features.</strong>  
								<p>The following hardware features are not orderable on zEC12 or zBC12 servers. If they are installed on your existing server at the time of an upgrade to a zEC12 or zBC12 server, they can be retained or carried forward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<p>You can perform the following upgrade actions before you order or install a zEC12 or zBC12 server:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the sysplex configuration in which the zEC12 or zBC12 server will participate.</strong> See 
								<a class="xref" href="#znextres21">Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a> for the limitations of using zEC12 or zBC12 servers with certain earlier servers in a Parallel Sysplex.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Implement STP (or a Mixed-CTN) timing network.</strong> This action is necessitated because Sysplex Timers (9037-002) are not supported on zEC12 or zBC12 servers.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from ICB-4 to InfiniBand coupling links.</strong> This action is necessitated because ICB-4 links are not supported on zEC12 or zBC12 servers. If desired, you can take this action after you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server, as you upgrade to the new server.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Migrate from unsupported hardware features to newer technology.</strong> This action is necessitated because FICON Express, FICON Express2, Crypto Express2, and OSA-Express2 10 GbE LR are not supported on zEnterprise servers. See 
								<a class="xref" href="#znextres21">Restrictions for a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a>, 
								<a class="xref" href="#at3ruio">Replace unsupported devices</a>, and 
								<a class="xref" href="#au3ndv">Provide for new device installations</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Install the necessary z/OS service, as indicated in PSP buckets.</strong>  
								<ul> 
									<li>For an IBM zEnterprise BC12 CPC, PTFs are identified in the in the 
										<code>2828DEVICE PSP</code> bucket ( 
										<code>Subset 2828/ZOS</code>).
									</li>  
									<li>For an IBM zEnterprise EC12 CPC, PTFs are identified in the 
										<code>2827DEVICE PSP</code> bucket ( 
										<code>Subset 2827/ZOS</code>).
									</li>  
									<li>For an IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) attached to your zEC12 CPC or zBC12 CPC, the PTFs are identified in the 
										<code>2458DEVICE PSP</code> bucket ( 
										<code>Subset 2458/ZOS</code>).
									</li> 
								</ul> In each PSP bucket, the content is dependent on the z/OS release you will run on the zEnterprise server. If you reviewed the PSP buckets some time ago, review them again to ensure that any newly identified z/OS service has been installed. To assist you in determining if you have the recommended service (identified in these PSP buckets) installed on your system, you can use the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command in conjunction with the FIXCAT type of HOLDDATA, as follows: 
								<ol> 
									<li>Acquire and RECEIVE the latest HOLDDATA onto your z/OS system(s). Use your normal service acquisition portals or download the two (2) year HOLDDATA directly from 
										<a class="xref" href="http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Enhanced HOLDDATA for z/OS</a>. Ensure that you select Full from the Download NOW column (last 730 days) to receive the FIXCAT HOLDDATA, as the other files do not contain FIXCAT HOLDDATA.
									</li>  
									<li>Run the SMP/E REPORT MISSINGFIX command on your z/OS systems and specify one or more of the following Fix Categories (FIXCAT): 
										<ul> 
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.zEC12-2827</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.zEC12-2827.Exploitation</li>  
											<li>IBM.Device.Server.zEC12-2827.ParallelSysplexInfiniBandCoupling</li>

											<li>IBM.Device.Server.zBC12-2828.UnifiedResourceManager</li> 
										</ul>  
										<p>The report will identify any missing coexistence and fallback PTFs for that system. For complete information about the REPORT MISSINGFIX command, see 
											<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.gim1000/abstract.htm">z/OS SMP/E Commands</a>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>Periodically, you might want to acquire the latest HOLDDATA and rerun the REPORT MISSINGFIX command to find out if there are any new PTFs recommended for the zEnterprise servers.</li> 
								</ol> Notes: 
								<ol> 
									<li>You can also use Service Link's PSP Service Extraction tool.</li>  
									<li>Because the Enhanced PSP Tool (EPSPT) was removed the end of 2010, you can no longer use that tool to identify missing PSP bucket service. You should use SMP/E Fix Category support, which is fully integrated into SMP/E procedures and IBM product and service deliverables.</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Run the CFSIZER tool.</strong> If you are moving your coupling facilities and the coupling facility structures will be on a higher CFLEVEL than they were previously, run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSIZER) tool to find out if you have to increase coupling facility structure sizes. 
								<p>If ordered before September 2013, zEC12 servers initially ship with CFLEVEL 18. For zEC12 and zBC12 servers ordered after September 2013, the servers ship with CFLEVEL 19; prepare to make the necessary changes as indicated by the tool.</p>  
								<p>You can download the CFSIZER tool at 
									<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1027062" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Coupling Facility sizer</a>. Also see 
									<a class="xref" href="#au3cpfl">Update your CFRM policy with coupling facility structure size changes</a>.
								</p> Note: 
								<p>After you make a coupling facility available on the new hardware, you can run the Sizer utility, an authorized z/OS program, to evaluate structure size changes. The Sizer utility is distinct from CFSIZER, and should be run after the new hardware (CFLEVEL) is installed, but before any CF LPAR on the new hardware is populated with structures. You can download the Sizer utility at

								<strong>Decide on the steps you will take for your migration to a zEC12 or zBC12 server.</strong> In addition to the steps listed here in 
								<a class="xref" href="#znextbef21">Actions you can take before you order a zEC12 or zBC12 server</a>, as a guide, also see 
								<a class="xref" href="#znextaft21a">Migration and exploitation considerations for zEC12 and zBC12 server functions</a>. Also, note the following web deliverables considerations. 
								<p>The level of function provided for cryptographic support differs by z/OS release and the ICSF web deliverable that is installed. Toleration PTFs are also available for some cryptographic web deliverables:</p>  
								<p>Consider the following:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>For z/OS V1R13 and z/OS V2R1, if you require the cryptographic enhancements support for CCA (including Export TDES key under AES transport key, Diversified Key Generation CBC, IPEK, RKX key wrapping method, and integration of UDX into CCA), you must install the web deliverable Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 (FMID HCR77A1). You must also perform the required ICSF upgrade actions.</li>  
									<li> 
										<strong>PTFs for coexistence:</strong> Coexistence PTFs must be installed on older levels of ICSF. To assist in identifying the coexistence service, you can use the following Fix Categories: 
										<ul> 
											<li>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R11-V1R13-HCR7790</li>  
											<li>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R12-V1R13-HCR77A0</li>  
											<li>IBM.Coexistence.ICSF.z/OS_V1R13-V2R1-HCR77A1</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>If you plan to use the IBM zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) feature, you must enable it, similar to enabling other z/OS priced features. To do so, you must:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Notify IBM that you are using the feature</li>  
									<li>Update the IFAPRDxx PARMLIB member to specify that the z/OS ZEDC software feature is enabled</li>  
									<li>Follow the z/OS documentation to customize the exploiting functions.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>You should also ensure that all z/OS V1R13 systems that will access zEDC compressed data have the required toleration maintenance installed to enable software decompression.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Review the new mnemonics introduced for the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</strong> The new mnemonics might collide with (be identical to) the names of assembler macro instructions you use or provide. In the event of such collisions, the HLASM default opcode table (UNI) treats specification of these names as instructions when APAR PM49761 and PM86821 are installed. This will probably cause assembler error messages and possibly cause generation of incorrect object code. 
								<p>If you write programs in Assembler Language, you should compare the list provided in 
									<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>, SA22-7832 to the names of assembler macro instructions you use or provide, to identify any such conflicts or collisions that would occur following installation of HLASM APAR PM49761 and PM86821. If a conflict is identified, take one of the following actions:
								</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Change the name of your macro instruction.</li>  
									<li>Specify PARM='...OPTABLE(YOP)...' (or some other earlier opcode table).</li>  
									<li>Specify a separate ASMAOPT file containing assembler options, such as in the previous method (this method requires no changes to source code or JCL).</li>  
									<li>Add, as the first statement of your source program, *PROCESS OPTABLE(YOP).</li>  
									<li>Specify the PROFILE option either in JCL or the ASMAOPT file, and the specified or default member of the SYSLIB data set is copied into the front of the source program.</li>  
									<li>If you must use both a new instruction and a macro with the same name in an assembly, you can use the following technique (where XXX is a sample mnemonic): 
										<pre> 
<code>Assume the default OPTABLE(UNI) is in effect XXX a,b new instruction PUSH ACONTROL save current optable definition ACONTROL OPTABLE(YOP) switch optable dynamically XXX r,s,t macro invocation POP ACONTROL restore previous definition XXX c,d new instruction</code>
										</pre> 
									</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For more information about HLASM opcode table, see 
									<cite>HLASM Programmer's Guide</cite>, which is available at 
									<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSENW6" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">High Level Assembler and Toolkit Feature in IBM Knowledge Center</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Plan for changes to your global resource serialization complex with the zEC12 or zBC12 server.</strong> If you use a global resource serialization ring complex that spans more systems than is part of the sysplex or does not use sysplex signaling for communications within the complex, you need to take upgrade actions. Instead of using global resource serialization ring, consider using the global resource serialization star configuration in a sysplex. You can take the following actions before you install the zEC12 or zBC12 server: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Migrate to a Parallel Sysplex that uses the recommended global resource serialization star complex.</li>  
									<li>Convert to a basic sysplex that uses XCF sysplex signaling with global resource serialization ring instead of GRS-managed channel-to-channel (CTC) communications.</li>

							<strong>Consider the number of CPU measurement facility counters for zEC12 or zBC12.</strong> The number of CPU measurement facility counters for zEC12 and zBC12 is increased to 128. More extended counters means that more internal storage is required. Though the structure of the SMF 113 record does not change, the values, interpretations, and frequency of certain sections do change; therefore, current tools using the data must be updated for the zEC12 or zBC12.
						</p>  
						<p>For example, consider the following SMF record field:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>SMF113_2_CtrVN2 identifies how to interpret the Crypto and Extended counter sets. As described in 
								<cite>The IBM CPU Measurement Facility Extended Counters Definition for z10 and z196</cite>, SA23-2260, this field is set to 1 (for z10), 2 (for z196 or z114), or 3 (for zEC12 and zBC12).
							</li> 
						</ul> Note: 
						<p>As of z/OS V2R1, if you use the CPU Measurement Facility, IBM recommends that your installation collect SMF 113 subtype 1 and 2 records. IBM also recommends that products process SMF 113 subtype 1 records when available, because that is where future enhancements will be made. If subtype 1 records are not available, products can process subtype 2 records.</p>  
						<p>The following zEC12 and zBC12 functions are available on z/OS V2R1. For PTF information, see the

							<a class="xref" href="#znext21__znextbcexp1" title="This table shows a summary view of which zEC12 and zBC12 server functions can be exploited in z/OS V2R2, z/OS V2R3, and z/OS V2R4.">Table 37</a>:
						</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>CFLEVEL 19 Coupling thin interrupt support.</strong> With PTFs CFLEVEL 19 provides Coupling thin interrupt support that allows a shared logical coupling facility partition to be dispatched by PR/SM if not already dispatched and allows for more timely processing of events to which the CF must respond. It is designed to improve service times for shared engine coupling facilities, and to help improve the response time for asynchronous CF operations. This function requires CFLEVEL 19.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Cryptographic Enhancements.</strong> Cryptographic enhancements for z/OS V2R1 on zEC12 and zBC12 server include: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Crypto Express4S CCA enhancements when the PCIe adapter is configured as CCA coprocessor including: Export TDES key under AES transport key, Diversified Key Generation CBC, IPEK, RKX key wrapping method, and Integration of UDX into CCA requires z/OS V2R1 with the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 Web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) installed.</li>  
									<li>Crypto Express4S EP11 enhancements when the Crypto Express4S PCIe adapter is configured as an EP11 coprocessor including: (PKCS #11 V2R1 PSS, EP11 Key agreement algorithms, and Offload Generation of Domain Parameters) and requires z/OS V2R1 with the Cryptographic Support for z/OS V1R13-z/OS V2R1 Web deliverable (FMID HCR77A1) to be installed.</li>

					<title>Accommodate functions for the zEC12 and zBC12 servers to be discontinued on future servers</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>The following changes in hardware support could affect your environment. Make the appropriate changes as needed.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for connections to an STP Mixed CTN.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 are the last IBM Z® servers to support connections to an STP Mixed CTN. This also includes the Sysplex Timer (9037). After the zEC12 and the zBC12, servers that require Time synchronization, such as to support a base or Parallel Sysplex, will Require Server Time Protocol (STP) and all servers in that network must be configured in STP-only mode.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for Ethernet half-duplex operation and 10 Mbps link data rate.</strong> The OSA-Express4S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature is planned to be the last copper Ethernet feature to support half-duplex operation and a 10 Mbps link data rate. The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to support half-duplex operation and a 10 Mbps link data rate for copper Ethernet environments. Any future 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature will support full-duplex operation and auto-negotiation to 100 or 1000 Mbps exclusively. This hardware statement of direction is fulfilled with the delivery of OSA-Express5S.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of ISC-3 support on IBM Z®.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to offer support of the InterSystem Channel-3 (ISC-3) for Parallel Sysplex environments at extended distances. ISC-3 will not be supported on future IBM Z® servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Previously, it was announced that the IBM zEnterprise 196 (z196) and IBM zEnterprise 114 (z114) servers were the last to offer ordering of ISC-3. Enterprises should continue upgrading from ISC-3 features (#0217, #0218, #0219) to 12x InfiniBand (#0171 - HCA3-O fanout) or 1x InfiniBand (#0170 - HCA3-O LR fanout) coupling links.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of OSA-Express3 support on IBM Z®.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to offer support of the Open System Adapter-Express3 (OSA-Express3 #3362, #3363, #3367, #3370, #3371) family of features. OSA-Express3 will not be supported on future IBM Z® servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Enterprises should continue upgrading from the OSA-Express3 features to the OSA-Express4S (#0404, #0405, #0406, #0407, #0408) and OSA-Express5S features (#0413, #0414, #0415, #0416, #0417).
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of FICON Express4 support on IBM Z®.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to offer support of the FICON Express4 features (#3321, #3322). FICON Express4 will not be supported on future IBM Z® servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Enterprises should continue upgrading from the FICON Express4 features to the FICON Express8S features (#0409, #0410).
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of Crypto Express3 support on IBM Z®.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 servers are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to offer support of the Crypto Express3 features (#0864 and #0871 - zBC12). Crypto Express3 will not be supported on future IBM Z® servers as carry forward on an upgrade. Enterprises should continue upgrading from the Crypto Express3 features to the Crypto Express4S feature (#0865).
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>IBM z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) and IBM zEnterprise Application Assist Processor (zAAP) simplification.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to offer support for zAAP specialty engine processors. IBM intends to continue support for running zAAP workloads on zIIP processors ( 
								<q>zAAP on zIIP</q>). This change is intended to help simplify capacity planning and performance management, while still supporting all the currently eligible workloads.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for the HCA2-O fanouts for 12x IFB and 1x IFB InfiniBand coupling links.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to support the following features as carry forward on an upgrade: HCA2-O fanout for 12x IFB coupling links (#0163) and HCA2-O LR fanout for 1x IFB coupling links (#0168). Enterprises should continue upgrading to the HCA3-O fanout for 12x IFB (#0171) and the HCA3-O LR fanout for 1x IFB (#0170).
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Removal of support for IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame types.</strong> The zEC12 and zBC12 are planned to be the last IBM Z® servers to support IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame types. All OSA-Express features supported on future IBM Z® servers are planned to support DIX Version 2 (DIX V2) exclusively.

				<title>Enable BCPii communications on the support element</title>  
				<description><![CDATA[  
					<h4>Description</h4>  
					<p>It is necessary to grant authority on the support element (SE) to allow the support element to accept the BCPii APIs flowing from the user application through the HWIBCPii address space. With this enablement, a logical partition can issue a subset of control program instructions to other logical partitions that are activated on the same CPC.</p>  
					<p>For Support Elements that run on z14, the method for enabling cross-partition authority is changed from previous IBM Z® servers. The setting of the cross-partition authority checkbox is replaced by new security settings in the Hardware Management Console (HMC) and the Support Element (SE), as follows:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li>CPC permission is now specified by using the System Details task.</li>  
						<li>Image (LPAR) permission is now specified by using the Image Activation Profile or the Change LPAR Security task.</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>These new security controls allow for more granular control for specifying BCPii send and receive capabilities. For example, you can enable all partitions or a subset of partitions to receive BCPii requests.</p>  
					<p>For previous IBM Z® servers, you enabled cross-partition authority by selecting the cross-partition checkbox. You selected this option on the local SE for the CPC of the image that the z/OS BCPii application is running on, plus any other systems for which BCPii communication was required.</p> This table provides more details about the upgrade action. Use this information to plan your changes to the system.

					<h4>Steps to take</h4>  
					<strong>To maintain the same permissions:</strong>  
					<p>If you are migrating from an earlier IBM Z® server to the z14, and you want to maintain the same BCPii permissions on the z14, you can port (export/import) your definitions to the new server. Then, perform the following steps on the HMC:</p>  
					<ol> 
						<li>Select Systems Management</li>  
						<li>Select the CPC that is required.</li>  
						<li>Click the System Details task.</li>  
						<li>Click the Security tab to display the default settings. 
							<ul> 
								<li>To grant authority to all partitions on all CPCs to issue BCPii calls against this CPC, ensure that the following options are selected: 
									<ol> 
										<li>Enable the system to receive commands from partitions</li>  
										<li>All partitions</li> 
									</ol> 
								</li> 
							</ul> 
						</li>  
						<li>Select CPC Operational Customization 
							<abbr>&gt;</abbr> Change LPAR Security. For each LPAR that was identified to support BCPii on the pre-z14 machine, click the current BCPii enablement level in the BCPii Permissions column and perform the following: 
							<ul> 
								<li>Ensure that the option Enable the partition to send commands is selected to grant authority for this LPAR to send BCPii requests to other CPCs and LPARs.</li>  
								<li>Ensure that the option Enable the partition to receive commands from other partitions is selected to allow other LPARs to target this LPAR with BCPii requests.</li>  
								<li>Ensure that the option All partitions is selected, which grants all partitions on all CPCs permission to issue BCPii calls against this LPAR.</li> 
							</ul> 
						</li> 
					</ol>  
					<p> 
						<strong>To use more granular permissions:</strong> If you are migrating from an earlier IBM Z® server, and you want to use more granular BCPii permissions on the z14, you can select individual partitions by using the Selected partitions option for both CPC and LPAR authority.
					</p>  
					<strong>To disable permissions:</strong>  
					<p>If you do not want to enable BCPii permissions on the z14, perform the following steps on the HMC:</p>  
					<ol> 
						<li>Select Systems Management</li>  
						<li>Select the CPC that is required.</li>  
						<li>Click the System Details task.</li>  
						<li>Click the Security tab to display the default settings.</li>  
						<li>To deny authority to LPARs to issue BCPii calls against this CPC, ensure that the option Enable the system to receive commands from partitions is not selected.</li> 
					</ol>  
					<p>If your installation has just a few LPARs for which to disable permissions, consider the following steps:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li>Select CPC Operational Customization 
							<abbr>&gt;</abbr> Change LPAR Security. For each LPAR that is not disabled, select the BCPii enablement level in the BCPii Permissions column and do the following: 
							<ol> 
								<li>Deselect the option Enable the partition to send commands. This action denies authority for this LPAR to send BCPii requests to other CPCs and LPARs.</li>  
								<li>Deselect the option Enable the partitions to receive commands from other partitions. This action prevents other LPARs from sending BCPii requests to this LPAR.</li> 
							</ol> 
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<p>If your installation has multiple LPARs for which to disable BCPii permissions, consider changing multiple Image Activation Profiles at one time. To do so, follow these steps:</p>  
					<ol> 
						<li>Select CPC Operational Customization 
							<abbr>&gt;</abbr> Customize/Delete Activation Profiles
						</li>  
						<li>Select multiple images for which you want to change the BCPii permissions.</li>  
						<li>Select the option Customize profile.</li>  
						<li>Select Next until the Security page is shown.</li>  
						<li>For BCPii permissions, select Apply to all profiles and deselect the options Send and Receive.</li>  
						<li>Select Next until Summary is shown. Review your changes.</li>  
						<li>If the settings are correct, select Finish to save your changes. Otherwise, if the settings are not correct, select Back to return to the tasks and make corrections. Or, select Cancel to end your session.</li> 
					</ol>

					</table>  
					<h4>Steps to take</h4>  
					<p>The following are general considerations related to I/O device support.</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li> 
							<em>Attaching devices through HCD.</em> You can define, or attach, new devices to your system through the interactive panels of the Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) base element. HCD has dynamic I/O capabilities, changing hardware definitions without the need for an IPL or hard power-on reset. 
							<p>Any time you make changes to your I/O configuration, you need to use HCD to modify your system's I/O definition file (IODF). You should also update the input/output configuration data set (IOCDS) when you run HCD to ensure that the configuration information is consistent across the software and microcode.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<em>Operating modes.</em> Most devices attached to z/OS operate in full function mode, that is, all features on the device are compatible with, and usable on, the operating system. Some of these features include: 
							<ul> 
								<li>For DASD devices: dynamic path reconnection, extended count-key-data operation, and caching and cache-related facilities</li>  
								<li>For tape devices: cartridge stack loading and data compaction.</li> 
							</ul>  
							<p>Some devices also operate in compatibility mode, which allows you to simulate the function of another device or model. Compatibility mode causes the device to function like a different device of the same type, ignoring some or all of the additional features the device might have. This allows you to migrate between devices with minimal impact on programs that have device dependencies.</p> 
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<em>UCB virtual storage constraint relief.</em> Each device attached to the system has one or more UCBs associated with it. The size of the I/O configuration and placement of UCBs affects the amount of available virtual memory, both below 16MB and below 2GB. For more information, see the description of the LOCANY parameter in 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ieag800/abstract.htm">z/OS HCD Planning</a> and the topic 
							<em>"Module placement effect on virtual storage"</em> in 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ieae100/abstract.htm">z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Guide</a>. The system programmer should review the contents of the link pack area (LPA) list to determine whether to remove or move libraries to gain virtual storage constraint relief.
						</li>  
						<li> 
							<em>Hardware maintenance.</em> Some devices require a specific level of hardware maintenance to operate properly on a z/OS system. DFSMS software support for new hardware devices might also require the installation of PTFs.
						</li> 
					</ul>  
					<h4>Reference information</h4>  
					<p>For more information, see the following references:</p>  
					<ul> 
						<li>For a summary of the most commonly-used I/O devices supported by z/OS that are also directly supported by DFSMS functions, see the topic about identifying I/O devices in

					<h4>Steps to take</h4>  
					<p>If you are upgrading to a new CFLEVEL, do the following:</p>  
					<ol> 
						<li>Run the Coupling Facility Structure Sizer (CFSizer) tool. This tool sizes structures based on the amount of space needed for the current CFLEVEL. The tool sizes for the most currently available level; you might find that the results are oversized if you use an earlier CFLEVEL. You can find the tool at 
							<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1027062" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Coupling Facility sizer</a>. 
							<p>Alternatively, you can run an as-is batch utility program that is called SIZER after you bring a new CFLEVEL coupling facility into use in your configuration. SIZER examines your currently allocated coupling facility structures and recalculates the size that should be used for them with the new later-CFLEVEL coupling facility. The as-is SIZER utility is available as a compressed package that you can download from 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1025939" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">CFSizer Alternate Sizing Techniques</a>.
							</p> 
						</li>  
						<li>Update the CFRM policy with the size modifications that are needed.</li>  
						<li>Activate the updated CFRM policy so that it becomes the active policy that governs structure allocation in the sysplex.</li> 
					</ol>

						<p>To run in distributed mode, you must perform a sysplex-wide migration to distributed mode. You can do so through a sysplex-wide IPL or dynamically, by using the command SETCON MODE=DISTRIBUTED. To perform the migration, all of your systems must be z/OS V1R10 or later.</p> Note: 
						<p>For a monoplex configuration, an IPL is required to migrate to distributed mode.</p> Tip: 
						<p>On a z/OS V2R2 system, you can determine the current console operation mode at any time by using the DISPLAY OPDATA,MODE command. In z/OS V2R3 and later, with the change from console mode to distributed mode, this command is removed.</p>

					<instructions>This portion of the Workflow will guide you to submit a job to run an IBM Health Check for z/OS associated with this upgrade action, 
						<strong>IBMCNZ,CNZ_CONSOLE_OPERATING_MODE</strong>. 
						<p>This check will be activated if it is not already active. If the check is activated, it will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that it remains in the same state as it was found.</p>  
						<p>If the health check runs with no exception, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this upgrade action requires no more activity.</p>  
						<p>If the health check finds an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this upgrade action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>  
						<p>This health check has been removed in z/OS V2.3. If you attempt to run this step on a z/OS V2.3 system, it will not be found.</p>

					<title>Evaluate absolute hardware capping limits for temporary capacity demands</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>The Provisioning Manager monitors systems for defined absolute hardware LPAR limits, to detect the possibility that more temporary On/Off Capacity on Demand (OOCoD) capacity might not be absorbed by capped LPARs. The Capacity Provisioning Manager allows for enabling or to disabling of the awareness of absolute hardware LPAR capping.</p>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3, the Provisioning Manager suppresses, by default, any activation of temporary OOCoD capacity that is triggered by workload running on LPARs that are capped by an absolute hardware LPAR limit. In previous releases, the Provisioning Manager recognized workload demands and activated temporary OOCoD capacity, regardless of whether the LPAR Absolute Hardware LPAR limit was set.</p>  
						<p>Consider whether to disable this default to allow the activations. If so, see the instructions in 
							<a class="xref" href="#ThisIsTheAbsoluteLimit__OCDsteps">Steps to take</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>The detailed workload report indicates when the Provisioning Manager suppresses the activation of temporary OOCoD capacity, that is, when the activation of temporary OOCoD capacity might be triggered by workload requirements, but is disallowed by the enabled function. The report indicates types of processor demand that the Provisioning Manager is detecting, and the reason why Provisioning Manager is not recognizing a specific demand. The report also shows when a demand was not recognized due to the detection of an absolute hardware LPAR limit.</p>

						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Use multivolume stand-alone dump data sets. Adjust the number of volumes and their separation to achieve tolerable stand-alone dump capture times.</li>  
							<li>Use extended-format sequential data sets or large format sequential data sets. Copy their contents to an extended-format, compressed, striped data set using the IPCS COPYDUMP subcommand before analysis. Use the same or a larger striping factor than you used for your stand-alone dump data sets. Dump data sets to which stand-alone dump can write may be neither compressed nor striped, but both attributes are advantageous for the target of the copy operation. Starting with z/OS V1R12, stand-alone dump data sets can be placed in track-managed space as well as cylinder-managed space on Extended Address Volumes (EAV).</li>  
							<li>Use a large CISIZE and striping for IPCS dump directories, and use blocking, striping, and compression for the stand-alone dump data set. Very large stand-alone dumps might require that you define your directory with the extended addressing attribute, allowing it to hold more than 4 GB. Tip: 
								<p>Control interval sizes less than 24K have been shown to be more vulnerable to fragmentation when used as IPCS dump directories, and IPCS performance can be degraded when such fragmentation occurs. In this background, warning message BLS21110I will be issued and you might recreate the DDIR by using the CLIST BLSCDDIR.</p>

<code>BLS21110I CISIZE(cisize) is less than 24K. It may degrade IPCS performance</code>

					<title>BCP: Prepare for the removal of service coefficients from WLM service definitions</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS V2R4 is the last release of the operating system to support specifying service coefficients in the WLM service definition.</p>  
						<p>The amount of system resources an address space or enclave consumes is measured in service units. Service units are calculated based on the CPU, SRB, I/O, and storage (MSO) service the address space or enclave consumes.</p>  
						<p>Service units are the basis for period switching within a service class that has multiple periods. The duration of a service class period is specified in terms of service units. When an address space or enclave running in the service class period has consumed the amount of service that is specified by the duration, workload management moves it to the next period. The work is then managed to the goal and importance of the new period.</p>  
						<p>Because not all kinds of services are equal in every installation, more weight can be assigned to one kind of service over another. These weights are called service coefficients.</p>  
						<p>Assigning different weights made sense in the past, when resources like storage and I/O were scarce. However, in today's environments, it does not make sense to allow storage and I/O to influence period switch, or weight CPU and SRB service differently. Therefore, to streamline and simplify user experience, and to facilitate more consistent management, the service coefficients are removed from the WLM service definition, and set to hardcoded defaults.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>For z/OS V2R4 with the IBM z14 (z14) server, a minimum of 8 GB of real memory is required to IPL. When running as a z/VM guest or on an IBM Z® Personal Development Tool (zPDT), a minimum of 2 GB is required for z/OS V2R4.</p>  
						<p>If you attempt to IPL z/OS V2R4 on a z14 with less than the minimum amount of real memory, z/OS issues the following warning message (a WTOR) during IPL:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>IAR057D LESS THAN 8 GB OF REAL STORAGE IMPACTS SYSTEM AVAILABILITY - ADD STORAGE OR REPLY C TO CONTINUE</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>Continuing with less than the minimum amount of real memory might impact the availability of your system. If you attempt to IPL z/OS V2R4 on an earlier IBM server, no warning message is issued.</p>  
						<p>To help you with upgrading from z/OS V2R2, IBM provides a new health check, IBMRSM,ZOSMIGV2R3_RSM_MINIMUM_REAL, which issues a warning for a system that is configured with less than 8 GB of real memory.</p> This table provides more details about the upgrade action.

If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation that you find appropriate. You can then re-run this Workflow step to submit the health check job again, until the health check no longer receives an exception and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

						<p>In parmlib member IEASYSxx, the REAL parameter controls the amount of central storage that can be allocated for ADDRSPC=REAL (V=R) jobs. The V=R (virtual=real) area is a dedicated storage area below 16 MB in which virtual addresses are the same as real addresses.</p>  
						<p>In previous releases, the REAL parameter had a default value of 76, which means that 76 KB of V=R storage was reserved on the system. In z/OS V2R3, the REAL parameter default is changed to 0, which means that no V=R area is created.</p>  
						<p>For improved performance in satisfying storage requests, IBM suggests that you do not create a V=R area and instead, set REAL to 0 (the new default).</p>

						<p>On a z/OS V2R2 system, do the following:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Review the current setting of the REAL parameter on your system by checking the IEASYSxx parmlib concatenation. If the 
								<code>REAL=</code> setting is specified, you have nothing more to do. Otherwise, proceed to Step 2.
							</li>  
							<li>Search for the 
								<em>Storage and Paging Section</em> of SMF type 30 (common address space work) subtype 4 records. Locate the SMF30SFL field within the record. If bit 0 is 
								<code>1</code>, the V=R area is used by a job. Add the setting 
								<code>REAL=76</code> to your IEASYSxx member to maintain compatibility with z/OS V2R2.
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>Alternatively, you can follow these steps on a z/OS V2R4 system:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Before you IPL the system, review the current setting of the REAL parameter on your system by checking the IEASYSxx parmlib concatenation. If the 
								<code>REAL=</code> setting is specified, you have nothing more to do. Otherwise, proceed to Step 2.
							</li>  
							<li>Add the setting 
								<code>REAL=76</code> to your IEASYSxx parmlib member before IPLing the system. After IPL, use the Generic Tracker to identify V=R jobs. If any are identified, leave the setting. Otherwise, remove the setting and use the default of 0 for subsequent IPLs.
							</li> 
						</ol> Tip: 
						<p>In the SMF Type 30 subtype 4 record, in the paging and storage section, check bit 0 of the byte labeled SMF30SFL. This bit is set to 1 to indicate V=R usage for the job step.</p>

					<title>BCP: Removal of support for user key common areas</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>IBM strongly recommends that you eliminate all use of user key common storage. Allowing programs to obtain user key (8-15) common storage creates a security risk because the storage can be modified or referenced, even if fetch protected, by any unauthorized program from any address space. Therefore, without the restricted use common service area (RUCSA) optional priced feature, the obtaining of user key (8-15) storage is not supported in z/OSV2R4.</p>  
						<p>RUCSA is more secure because it can be managed as a SAF resource. However, it does not prevent two or more different SAF-authorized applications from altering or referencing another application's RUCSA storage. RUCSA became available as a part of the BCP base element with APAR OA56180 on earlier z/OS releases, but it is only available as a priced feature in z/OS V2R4.</p>  
						<p>Related to this change:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Support to change the key of common ESQA storage to a user key (via CHANGKEY) is removed regardless of RUCSA exploitation.</li>  
							<li>NUCLABEL DISABLE(IARXLUK2) is no longer a valid statement in the DIAGxx parmlib member. ( 
								<strong>Note:</strong> This statement only exists in z/OS V2R3.)
							</li>  
							<li>Support of user-key (8 - 15) SCOPE=COMMON data spaces is removed regardless of RUCSA exploitation.</li>  
							<li> 
								<code>YES</code> is no longer a valid setting for the following statements in the DIAGxx parmlib member: 
								<dl> 
									<dt>VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA</dt>  
									<dd>Controls the allocation of user key CSA.</dd>  
									<dt>ALLOWUSERKEYCADS</dt>  
									<dd>Controls the allocation of user key SCOPE=COMMON data spaces.</dd> 
								</dl>  
								<p>If set to 
									<code>YES</code> on a z/OS V2R4 system, these statements are treated as syntax errors with messages, such as the following:
								</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>SET DIAG=J2 IEE252I MEMBER DIAGJ2 FOUND IN D10JHM1.PARMLIB ASA002I SYNTAX ERROR IN PARMLIB MEMBER=DIAGJ2 LINE 17: 393 NO EXPECTED BEFORE &lt;NON-KEYWORD&gt;. DETECTING MODULE IS IGVDITMS.

						</table>  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<ol> 
							<li>On the production system that you are upgrading to z/OS V2R4, determine whether you are using user key common storage by checking the response to the following operator commands : 
								<ul> 
									<li>D IPLINFO,RUCSA . If RUCSA was specified with nonzero values, you are already using RUCSA and must do either of the following: 
										<ul> 
											<li>Upgrade to the z/OS V2R4 priced optional feature. For instructions, see 
												<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.e0zb100/abstract.htm">z/OS Planning for Installation</a>. No other steps are required. However, you might want to see whether you can reduce or possibly eliminate user key common storage usage by following the additional steps below.
											</li>  
											<li>Start with 
												<strong>Step 2</strong> below to remove all usage of user key common storage from your current system and then remove the use of RUCSA before IPLing z/OS V2R4.
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>D DIAG . If VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA and ALLOWUSERKEYCADS are set to 
										<code>NO</code> and you are not using RUCSA, no further action is required. You already prevent the use of user key common storage.
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Query all software vendor products to determine whether any service is required to eliminate the use of user key common storage. 
								<ul> 
									<li>If you are running CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, ensure that you are running V5.2 or a later version.</li>  
									<li>If you are running Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for DB2 PE/PM, apply APAR PI97225 ("Removed User Key CADS Creation").</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Check for usage of user key common areas, such as the following: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Using the STORAGE, GETMAIN or CPOOL service to obtain common ECSA/CSA storage (subpool 227, 228, 231, 241) that specifies a key of 8-15.</li>  
									<li>Using the DSPSERV service to allocate a SCOPE=COMMON data space in a key of 8-15.</li>  
									<li>Using the CHANGKEY service to change the storage key of common storage to a key of 8-15.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>To aid in finding all instances of user key common usage, apply the PTF for APAR OA53355 on your production system. Doing so allows you to take one or more of the following actions:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Enable the following example SLIP trap to produce GTF trace records to help in identifying software that uses user key common storage: 
										<pre> 
<code>SLIP SET,IF,A=TRACE,ID=UKEY,NUCEP=(IARXLUK4,0,1),TRDATA=(STD,REGS),END</code>
										</pre>  
										<p>In the GTF trace record, register 1 contains the address of the program that used user key common storage.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>Activate the ZOSMIGV2R3_NEXT_VSM_USERKEYCOMM health check. This health check issues an exception message when it detects usage of user key common storage.</li>  
									<li>Ensure that SMF Type 30 recording is active. The Storage and Paging section contains flags that indicate whether user key common storage is used. For information about the SMF30_UserKeyCsaUsage, SMF30_UserKeyCadsUsage and SMF30_UserKeyChangKeyUsage flags, see 
										<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ieag200/abstract.htm">z/OS MVS System Management Facilities (SMF)</a>.
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>If the PTF for APAR OA53355 is not applied, you can take one or more of the following actions to help find instances of user key common usage: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Set the DIAGxx parmlib statement VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA to 
										<code>NO</code>, which is the default. Then, IPL a test system with the updated setting. Any software on your test system that attempts to obtain user key CSA/ECSA storage by using the GETMAIN, STORAGE, or CPOOL service will fail. The service receives one of the following abends: B04-5C, B0A-5C, or B78-5C.
									</li>  
									<li>Specify ALLOWUSERKEYCADS(NO) in your DIAGxx parmlib. Then, IPL a test system with the updated setting. Any software on your test system that attempts to obtain a user key (8-15) SCOPE=COMMON data space fails with a 01D-xx0015xx abend.</li>  
									<li>On z/OS V2R3 systems and later, specify NUCLABEL ENABLE(IARXLUK2) in your DIAGxx parmlib member. Then, IPL a test system with the updated setting. Any software on your test system that attempts to use CHANGKEY to change subpool 247 or 248 common storage to a user key (8-15) will fail with a 08F-1C abend.</li>  
									<li>Enable the following example SLIP trap to produce GTF trace records to help in identifying software that obtains user key CSA/ECSA storage: 
										<pre> 
<code>SLIP SET,IF,A=TRACE,ID=UCSA,NUCEP=(IGVVSMG2,0,1),END</code>
										</pre> 
									</li>  
									<li>Enable the following example SLIP trap to produce GTF trace records to help in identifying software that allocates user key SCOPE=COMMON data spaces: 
										<pre> 
<code>SLIP SET,IF,A=TRACE,ID=UCAD,NUCEP=(IAXDKUKY,0,1),END</code>
										</pre> 
									</li>  
									<li>Check for usage of the CHANGKEY service to change the storage key of common storage to a key of 8-15.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Change the affected software to use a system key rather than a user key. Or, change the affected software to use storage that is not common to all address spaces. Some alternatives for sharing storage (instead of having storage common to all address spaces) include the following options: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Use a SCOPE=ALL data space to share data space storage with specific units of work in specific address spaces.</li>  
									<li>Use IARVSERV SHARE to share below-the-bar storage with specific address spaces.</li>  
									<li>Use IARV64 GETSHARED to share above-the-bar storage with specific address spaces.</li>  
									<li>Use z/OS UNIX shared memory to share below-the-bar or above-the-bar storage with specific address spaces.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>For those who cannot immediately eliminate all affected software programs or need more assistance in identifying the programs that reference user key CSA storage, the more secure restricted use common service area (RUCSA), an optional priced feature in z/OS V2R4 (and provided in the BCP base element by APAR OA56180 for earlier z/OS releases) can be used. However, IBM still recommends the elimination of all user key common storage. For more information about RUCSA and upgrading to it, see

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R3, the command to start Runtime Diagnostics is added to the IBM-supplied parmlib member IEACMD00. As a result, Runtime Diagnostics is started automatically during system initialization, when you include the SYS1.IBM.PARMLIB data set in your parmlib concatenation. This change means that it is no longer necessary for you to explicitly start Runtime Diagnostics after each system IPL, whether through the COMMNDxx parmlib member, an automation program, or an operator command entered manually at the console.</p>  
						<p>For example, in previous releases, you might have placed the start command in your COMMNDxx parmlib member, as follows:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>COM='S HZR,SUB=MSTR'</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>As in previous releases, the Runtime Diagnostics address space (HZR) continues to run as an address space under the master subsystem and remains active until you stop it with the 
							<code>STOP</code> command.
						</p> Tip: 
						<p>IBM recommends that you allow the HZR address space to be classified into the SYSSTC service class, or place it into an importance 1 single period service class with a high velocity goal.</p> This table provides more details about the upgrade action.

					<title>Define a SAF profile for the log stream subsystem exits</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of APAR OA51174, a log stream subsystem exit routine name is used only when it is one of the IBM-defined names, or the exit name is allowed through a SAF profile. Otherwise, z/OS does not invoke the exit routine name. Instead, z/OS issues message IXG507I and returns a failure indication to the log stream subsystem function (either converter or allocation).</p>  
						<p>Currently, log stream users can specify a log stream subsystem exit routine name to receive control for reading log data. Users can use either of the following methods to specify the exit routine names:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>On the JCL DDNAME statement, on the keyword SUBSYS=(LOGR,exit_routine_name,...)</li>  
							<li>On a dynamic allocation request that includes a text unit value for key DALSSPRM (exit routine name)</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>With APAR OA51174, this behavior is changed. To continue to specify an exit routine name as described here, your installation must protect the resource IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT.exit_routine_name, where exit_routine_name identifies the name of the log stream subsystem exit routine.</p>  
						<p>If your installation uses RACF as its security management product, your security administrator can protect the resource by defining a profile in the FACILITY class. If your installation uses a security management product other than RACF, your security administrator can refer to this topic for reference when creating an equivalent protection in the security management product on your system.</p>  
						<p>The exception to this requirement is if your installation uses the following IBM-defined names for the exit routines. If so, you have no upgrade action to perform.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>IXGSEXIT</li>  
							<li>IFASEXIT</li>  
							<li>IFBSEXIT</li>  
							<li>DFHLGCNV</li>

						<p>If your installation does not use any log stream subsystem exit routines, or if your installation uses only the IBM-defined names for the log stream subsystem exit routine names, you have no upgrade action to perform.</p>  
						<p>Otherwise, if your installation uses or plans to use log stream subsystem exit routine names other than the IBM-defined names, you must perform the following steps:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Define a discrete profile IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT.exit_routine_name for the FACILITY class, where exit_routine_name is the name of the log stream subsystem exit routine. Your security administrator can use this profile to audit access failures and grant users READ access. For example: 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE FACILITY IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT. exit_routine_name UACC(READ) AUDIT(FAILURES(READ))</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>If you need to allow for exit routine names that might not be explicitly known on your system, consider also defining the generic profile 
								<code>IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT.*</code> in the FACILITY class. Include the WARNING attribute in the profile definition (to issue a warning message, but allow access). This profile protects resources that are associated with the log stream subsystem exit routines. For example: 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE FACILITY IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT.* UACC(NONE) WARNING</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>When this generic profile is used to cover the authorization check for the resource IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT.exit_routine_name, if the check fails, RACF issues the appropriate warning message to the user, logs the access attempt, and allows the user to access the resource.</p>  
								<p>Using a generic profile is recommended only as a temporary means for gathering information on the possible exit routine names on your system that require protection. When the exit routine names are identified, you can define the appropriate discrete profiles. After you protect the known exit routine names with discrete profiles, delete the generic profile.</p> Note: 
								<p>If you do not define profiles as described here, but instead, define a generic profile that protects the resource 
									<code>IXGLOGR.SUBSYS.LSEXIT.exit_routine_name</code>, the generic profile attributes are used to determine the following behaviors:
								</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Outcome of the authorization checking</li>  
									<li>Logging</li>  
									<li>Whether the exit routine is invoked</li> 
								</ul>

						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3, system logger allows log stream staging data set sizes greater than 4 GB. In previous releases, you could request more than 4 GB for a log stream staging data set, but system logger would allocate a smaller amount of storage for the data set (about 3.5 GB).</p>  
						<p>The new support in z/OS V2R3 means that the z/OS V2R3 release systems allow log stream staging data set sizes with a size greater than 4 GB when the staging data sets are newly allocated on that system. Any z/OS V2R2 and z/OS V2R1 release levels in the same sysplex require the appropriate coexistence support to be compatible with z/OS V2R3 and correctly manage the larger data sets.</p>

						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Ensure that at least the following minimum level of Java is installed: 
								<ul> 
									<li>IBM 31-bit SDK for z/OS, Java Technology Edition, V8.0 (5655-DGG).</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Ensure that PFA users have READ access to the /etc/PFA/ini file. When PFA is started, PFA attempts to use the values in the /etc/PFA/ini file.</li>  
							<li>If the /etc/PFA/ini exists, update the PATH= and LIBPATH= statements to refer to the minimum level of Java. 
								<p>The following example shows the default PATH and LIBPATH values for Java 8.0:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>PATH= /usr/lpp/java/J8.0/lib/s390/classic:/usr/lpp/java/J8.0/lib/s390 LIBPATH=/usr/lpp/java/J8.0/lib/s390:/usr/lpp/java/J8.0/lib/s390/classic:/lib:/usr/lib:</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>If the /etc/PFA/ini file does not exist, copy it from /usr/lpp/bcp/samples/PFA/ini. If the path to the JDK for your installation is not the same as the path in the ini file, update it so that both the PATH= and LIBPATH= statements refer to the minimum level of Java.</li>  
							<li>If the /etc/PFA/ini file does not exist and you do not copy the sample file, when PFA starts, it attempts to copy the ini file from an existing PFA check directory. If no ini files exist in any of the PFA check directories, PFA copies the sample file that specifies the default path for Java 8. If the path to the JDK for your installation is not the same as the default, PFA issues a message and does not start.</li>

					<title>BCP: Running z/OS as a guest requires z/VM V6R4 or later</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Introduced on the IBM System z EC12, transactional execution (TX) is a hardware-based facility that supports the notion of "transactions" by using such instructions as TBEGIN, TBEGINC, TABORT, and TEND — all of which are described in 
							<cite>z/Architecture Principles of Operation</cite>. These instructions can be grouped into a transaction and any instructions that are used to update memory are committed to memory at the transaction's end.
						</p>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R3, many functions of an EC12 were required (and enforced), but not transactional execution. As a result, z/OS programs that were coded to use TX needed to be sensitive to their environment, as follows:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>z/OS not running under VM, TX is available.</li>  
							<li>z/OS running under VM V6R4 or later, TX is available.</li>  
							<li>z/OS running under VM V6R3 or earlier, TX is not available.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R4, running z/OS as a guest requires z/VM V6R4 or later. This requirement means that TX is available in all configurations.</p>  
						<p>A benefit of this change is that your programs no longer need to support a dual-path, regarding whether TX is available. In z/OS V2R4, the MACHMIG TX operand is still accepted, but is ignored. It is recommended, but not required, that you remove your use of this operand.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS V2R4 removes support for the BookManager READ element. IBM recommends that you use IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS, which was introduced in z/OS V2R2, to access product documentation on the web or from your own local repository.</p>  
						<p>IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS is the IBM platform for delivering product documentation. It is the replacement for both BookManager READ and Library Server.</p>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R2, IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS (KC4z) became a base element of z/OS. With KC4z, and Version 5 of the Softcopy Librarian tool, your installation can manage collections of Knowledge Center content (plug-ins) in your own repositories, and serve the content to users from those repositories.</p>  
						<p>KC4z provides function that is equivalent to BookManager READ and Library Server, as follows:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Similar to BookManager READ, you can use KC4z to manage your content collections. One difference is that KC4z provides a web interface to the documentation, rather than the“green screen” TSO/E interface as found in BookManager READ.</li>  
							<li>Similar to Library Server, you can use KC4z to host and serve documentation from your own server, within your intranet. By using links on the KC4z content Landing Page for each 
								<code>"z/OS elements+features"</code> product, KC4z can serve PDFs from the IBM Publications Center website. Or, if the PDFs are loaded into a KC4z repository on your system (using the collection of Adobe Indexed PDFs for 
								<code>"z/OS elements+features"</code>), the PDFs can be served from a local KC4z repository.
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R1, IBM ended its production of BookManager Book format publications. At this time, the need to continue reading documentation by using the BookManager READ “green screen” interface on TSO/E is much reduced or eliminated.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Remove any dependencies on BookManager READ from your system.</p>  
						<p>Check for the following uses:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Review any invocation of BookManager READ on any customized ISPF panels that you have provided.</li>  
							<li>Reading BookManager Book format documentation by using the BookManager READ “green screen” interface on TSO/E. Plan to replace your BookManager Book repository with a KC4z repository of Knowledge Center plugins.</li>  
							<li>Using the BookManager READ command line interface to access information in BookManager Book format documentation, such as the older “ green screen” version of the LookAT message tool.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>Replace any use of the BookManager READ command line interface that accesses information in BookManager Book documentation with a Knowledge Center based solution. IBM Knowledge Center includes a replacement for the legacy LookAT facility that was used for message look-ups. You can find it here: 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/lookatkc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM Z: Look@ Knowledge Center</a> 
						</p>  
						<p>In KC4z, the LookAT function can be configured to perform its message lookup against either the Knowledge Center hosted on ibm.com, or against a KC4z repository of Knowledge Center documentation hosted locally on your system.</p>  
						<p>If you still need the ability read legacy BookManager books, you can do so by moving the book files to a Windows system and using Softcopy Reader for Windows to read the files. This tool is available for download without charge from IBM Support Portal on ibm.com.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>It is recommended that you use HTTPS instead of HTTP, which allows the CIM server to use Application Transparent Layer Security (AT-TLS) functions. Here, the communication between the CIM client and the CIM server is encrypted.</p>  
						<p>You must also configure the CIM client applications to use HTTPS. Ensure that the applications run as CIM clients connected to the CIM server on HTTPS port 5989.</p>  
						<p>Fall back to HTTP is possible, though it is not secure and therefore not recommended.</p>  
						<p>If you need the CIM server to use the HTTP protocol on start-up, follow these steps:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Start the CIM server with the following settings specified in the configuration properties file: 
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<code>enableHttpConnection=true</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>enableHttpsConnection=false</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Alternatively, you can dynamically change the 
								<code>enableHttpConnection</code> value and restart the CIM server by entering either of these commands on the operations console: 
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<code>cimconfig -s enableHttpConnection= true -p</code> 
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>F CFZCIM,APPL=CONFIG,enableHttpConnection=true,PLANNED</code> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Reference information</h5>

						<p>As of z/OS V2R3 with TCP/IP APAR PI77649, or z/OS V2R2 with TCP/IP APAR PI77649 and SNA APAR OA52275, the processing of IPAQENET and IPAQENET6 INTERFACE statements is enhanced when you use OSA-Express6S. If you enabled QDIO inbound workload queuing (WORKLOADQ) and you have IPSec traffic, an additional ancillary input queue (AIQ) is established for IPSec inbound traffic. Additional storage is allocated for this input queue.</p>  
						<p>Each AIQ increases storage utilization in the following two areas:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Approximately 36 KB of fixed ECSA</li>  
							<li>64-bit CSM HVCOMMON for READSTORAGE 
								<p>If you are using IPSec, when the first IPSec tunnel is activated (protocols ESP or AH), the new AIQ is backed with 64-bit CSM HVCOMMON fixed storage. The amount of HVCOMMON storage that is used is based on the specification of the INTERFACE READSTORAGE parameter.</p> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If you configured QDIO inbound workload queuing (WORKLOADQ), ensure that sufficient fixed ECSA and fixed (real) 4 KB CSM HVCOMMON storage is available for the AIQ for IPSec traffic.</p>

							<li>If you are using or plan to use OSA-Express6S or later, verify that the following conditions are true: 
								<ul> 
									<li>WORKLOADQ is specified on the IPAQENET and IPAQENET6 INTERFACE statements.</li>  
									<li>Have IPSec traffic; protocols ESP or AH.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>If step 1 is applicable, IWQ IPSec uses additional storage. Continue with step 3 - 6. Otherwise, there is no increase in storage usage, and no further action is required.</li>  
							<li>To calculate the total storage increase, count the total number of IPAQENET and IPAQENET6 INTERFACE statements that are coded with the WORKLOADQ parameter that are associated with OSA-Express6S or later. Make a note of the number.</li>  
							<li>Verify that sufficient ECSA is available. To calculate this, multiply the total INTERFACE statements that are counted in step 3 by 36 KB. The resulting number indicates how much additional ECSA is required. 
								<p>To determine whether sufficient ECSA is available to enable this function, verify the following ECSA definitions:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>D CSM usage (PARMLIB member IVTPRM00, ECSA MAX value)</li>  
									<li>VTAM (Start Options CSALIMIT and CSA24)</li>  
									<li>TCPIP (GLOBALCONFIG ECSALIMIT statement in the TCPIP PROFILE)</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Verify that sufficient real (fixed) storage is available. 64-bit fixed (CSM HVCOMMON) storage is used for the IPSec AIQ read buffers. To calculate this value, multiply the total number of INTERFACE statements that are counted in step 3 by your configured READSTORAGE value (for example, 4 MB). You can verify how much storage is being used for READSTORAGE by using the D NET, TRLE command. The resulting number indicates how much additional fixed (64-bit) storage is required. To verify that the additional fixed storage is not a constraint for your system, take the following actions: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Use the DISPLAY CSM command to verify that sufficient fixed storage is available (CSM FIXED MAXIMUM defined in IVTPRM00).</li>  
									<li>Verify the actual amount of real storage available to this z/OS system by using D M=STOR or D M=HIGH.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>If sufficient ECSA or real storage is not available, increase the available real storage or consider defining some of the OSA-Express6S (or later) INTERFACE statements with the NOWORKLOADQ parameter. If your CSM FIXED MAXIMUM is too low, increase this value in IVTPRM00.</li>

						<p>These checks will be activated if they are not already active. If the checks are activated, they will be deactivated at the end of the job, so that they remain in the same state as they were found.</p>  
						<p>If the health checks run with no exceptions, this step will be marked "Complete" indicating that this upgrade action requires no more activity.</p>  
						<p>If the health checks find an exception, this step will be marked as "Failed". This tells you that further investigation (and possibly more work) is necessary to complete this upgrade action. If the step is marked "Failed", you should review the health check output (via any method you use to view health check output, such as SDSF) and correct any situation as you find appropriate. You can then re-run this workflow step to submit the health check jobs again, until the health checks no longer receive exceptions and the step is marked "Complete".</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Beginning with z/OS V2R3, Communications Server does not support using SMTPD or sendmail as an SMTP server for receiving mail for delivery to local TSO/E or z/OS UNIX user mailboxes, or for forwarding mail to other destinations. No replacement function is provided. 
								<ul> 
									<li>IBM suggests that customers who currently use sendmail for purposes other than sending mail (for example, as a mail transfer agent (MTA) or a mail submission agent (MSA)) migrate those functions to a compatible third-part solution or to other operating system platforms, such as Linux on z Systems.</li>  
									<li>IBM suggests that customers who currently use SMTPD for purposes other than sending mail from the z/OS JES spool migrate those mail functions to other operating system platforms, such as Linux on z Systems.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>If you are using the SMTPD NJE Gateway to send mail from the z/OS JES spool, migrate to the CSSMTP application. If you are using the SMTPD DBCS configuration statement, migrate to use the CSSMTP MBCS, TRANSLATE, and MBCharset configuration statements. For more details, see 
								<cite>Communications Server SMTP server</cite> in 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.halz001/abstract.htm">z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Reference</a> and

								<p>CSSMTP support for DBCS characters is added by TCP/IP APAR PI93278 for z/OS V2R2 and z/OS V2R3.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Before z/OS V2R3, SMTPNOTE could be used for SMTPD and CSSMTP. Check that the configured SMTPJOB value in the SMTPNOTE CLIST matches the ExtWrtName name of the CSSMTP job name, not the SMTPD job name. See 
								<cite>CSSMTP ExtWrtName statement</cite> in 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.halz001/abstract.htm">z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Reference</a>.
							</li>  
							<li>If your LPD server SERVICE statement is configured with the FAILEDJOB MAIL parameter, check that the 
								<em>server_name</em> of the SMTP statement is the CSSMTP external writer name, not the SMTPD job name. See 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.halz001/abstract.htm">z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Reference</a> for information on the LPD SERVICE statement and the CSSMTP ExtWrtName statement.
							</li>  
							<li>If you use the sendmail client, a compatible subset of functions for sendmail is provided through the new z/OS sendmail to CSSMTP bridge (sendmail bridge). This support requires that CSSMTP is configured and running. Verify that the function that is provided by the sendmail bridge meets your needs. 
								<ul> 
									<li>The sendmail bridge is only a mail client function. It does not provide the mail server function that the removed sendmail daemon provided.</li>  
									<li>The sendmail bridge requires that CSSMTP is configured and running.</li>  
									<li>The sendmail bridge uses JES spool files. For information about how to control and access the JES spool data sets, see 
										<cite>Steps for creating mail on the JES spool data set for CSSMTP</cite> in 
										<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.halz002/abstract.htm">z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide</a> 
									</li>  
									<li>For Transport Layer Security (TLS) support, the value that is defined on configuration statement 
										<code>D{tls_version}</code> is ignored. For more information about the 
										<code>D{tls_version}</code> configuration statement, see 
										<cite>sendmail bridge</cite> in 
										<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.halz001/abstract.htm">z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Reference</a>. The secured connection is set up between CSSMTP and target mail server based on configured AT-TLS policy. See 
										<cite>Steps for using Transport Layer Security for CSSMTP</cite> in 
										<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.halz002/abstract.htm">z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide</a>.
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>The trace option group SMTP for event trace SYSTCPIP is removed. If you have this option specified in the component trace SYS1.PARMLIB member (CTIEZB00 by default), remove it. Otherwise, the PARMLIB member is considered in error and none of the requested trace options are activated.</li>

If you find such a KeyExchangeOffer statement or IpDataOffer statement, your policy is affected. If you require the HowToEncrypt value to continue to use DES, update your policy to explicitly set the HowToEncrypt parameter to DES.

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R3, the default value for the DHGroup parameter on the KeyExchangeOffer statement in the IPSec policy was changed from Group1 to Group2. If you have an IPSec policy, determine whether this change affects your policy. If you use the IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server to configure your IPSec policy, an explicit DHGroup value is generated on every KeyExchangeOffer statement. A default value is not used. If you manually configure your IPSec policy, default values might be used.</p> Note: 
						<p>Diffie-Hellman group 1 is considered to be a weak algorithm and is therefore not recommended. Regardless of whether you use IBM Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server or manually configure your policies, you should evaluate your usage of DH group 1 and decide whether to plan an upgrade to a more secure group.</p>

										</table> Note: 
										<p>With the new default of ANONYMOUSLEVEL 3, the statement ANONYMOUSFILEACCESS is valid. If ANONYMOUSFILEACCESS is not explicitly specified, the default value of HFS is used, which is not compatible with the default value for STARTDIRECTORY. As a result, the anonymous login might be rejected by the FTP server after you migrate to z/OS V2R3.</p> Note: 
										<p>The value of STARTDIRECTORY must be compatible with the ANONYMOUSFILEACCESS value when anonymous logins are enabled and ANONYMOUSLEVEL is 3 or greater. For example, if ANONYMOUSLEVEL is 3, ANONYMOUSFILEACCESS is MVS, and STARTDIRECTORY is z/OS UNIX, anonymous users receive a filetype error when they attempt to log in to FTP. The anonymous login is rejected by the FTP server.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>To get the pre-V2R3 behavior, explicitly configure ANONYMOUSLEVEL 1 in the relevant FTP server configuration data set (FTP.DATA). Note: 
										<p>Specifying ANONYMOUSLEVEL less than 3 or ANONYMOUSFILETYPEJES TRUE allows anonymous users to submit jobs.</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>Optionally, disable anonymous access by removing the ANONYMOUS keyword.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ul> Note: 
						<p>If you choose to retain anonymous access, it is recommended that ANONYMOUSLEVEL is set to 3 and ANONYMOUSFILETYPEJES is set to FALSE to prevent job submission by anonymous users.</p>

						<p>Some utilities provided by Communications Server require the use of certain configuration files. You are responsible for providing these files if you expect to use the utilities. IBM provides default configuration files as samples in the 
							<code>/usr/lpp/tcpip/samples</code> directory. Before the first use of any of these utilities, you should copy these IBM-provided samples to the 
							<code>/etc</code> directory (in most cases). You can further customize these files to include installation-dependent information. An example is setting up the 
							<code>/etc/osnmpd.data</code> file by copying the sample file from 
							<code>/usr/lpp/tcpip/samples/osnmpd.data</code> to 
							<code>/etc/osnmpd.data</code> and then customizing it for the installation.
						</p>  
						<p>If you customized any of the configuration files that have changed, then you must incorporate the customization into the new versions of the configuration files.</p>

								<p>When the FTP client or server is configured with TLSMECHANISM FTP, it calls System SSL directly. To enable the weaker key length in this case, set the appropriate GSK_PEER_RSA_MIN_KEY_SIZE, GSK_PEER_DSA_MIN_KEY_SIZE, GSK_PEER_DH_MIN_KEY_SIZE, or GSK_PEER_ECC_MIN_KEY_SIZE environment variable to specify the required minimum key size before starting the FTP server or FTP client program.</p>

								<p>When the TN3270E Telnet server is configured with SECUREPORT, the related GSK environment variables cannot be passed to the TN3270E server. Therefore, the only way to enable the weaker key lengths is to enable the TN3270 for AT-TLS and then use the procedures described above for AT-TLS applications to enable the weaker key lengths. See

					<title>IP Services: Permit Communications Server components to ICSF resources required by Network Authenti</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R3, Kerberos relies on ICSF PKCS#11 callable services for encryption, decryption, and hashing. As a result of this change, ICSF is required to be running before any Kerberos components or applications are running on the z/OS system. The following z/OS Communications Server components use Kerberos in certain situations and might therefore require access to the ICSF callable services that Kerberos uses:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>With the UNIX System Services Telnet server, clients can support Kerberos version 5, as described in RFC 1416, to log in to the shell environment by using Kerberos as the authentication protocol.</li>  
							<li>FTP server and FTP client support connections to or from other servers and clients that support Kerberos version 5 authentication for the FTP protocol, as described in RFC 2228.</li>  
							<li>UNIX System Services RSH server can be configured to support client authentication by using Kerberos from RSH clients that support Kerberos version 5.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>In addition, the default encryption and checksum (hash) types that are used when not explicitly set in the Kerberos configuration files are being changed from weak and non-collision proof types to stronger, more secure types.</p>

						<p>Determine whether any of z/OS Communications Server components on your system are using Kerberos in the following conditions:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>If you use the UNIX System Services Telnet server (otelnetd), check your inetd configuration file (/etc/inetd.conf) for invocations of otelnetd that specify either the 
								<code>-a user</code> or 
								<code>-a valid</code> parameter. If you find such an invocation, your otelnetd server is using Kerberos version 5 authentication. If not, your otelnetd server is not affected.
							</li>  
							<li>If you use the FTP server, check the FTP.DATA data set of your server for the EXTENSIONS AUTH_GSSAPI parameter. If you find this parameter, your FTP server supports Kerberos version 5 authentication. If not, your FTP server is not affected.</li>  
							<li>If you use the FTP client command or API, check the FTP.DATA data set of each FTP client for the SECURE_MECHANISM GSSAPI parameter. If you find this parameter in any of those FTP.DATA data sets, those FTP clients use Kerberos version 5 authentication. Additionally, search for any invocations of the FTP command or FTP Client API that use the -a GSSAPI or the -r GSSAPI parameter, which also result in the use of Kerberos version 5 authentication. Any clients that use any of the above mechanisms are affected.</li>  
							<li>If you use the UNIX System Services RSH daemon (orshd), check your inetd configuration file (/etc/inetd.conf) for orshd with the -k KRB5 or the -k GSSAPI parameter. If you find these parameters, your orshd daemon uses Kerberos version 5 authentication. If not, your RSH daemon is not affected.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If any of the above components use Kerberos, you must perform the associated upgrade actions, as follows:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Ensure that ICSF is started and completes initialization before starting the z/OS KDC or any Kerberized applications on the system. ICSF needs to be running for the duration of use of all Kerberos functions, including KDC, application servers, application clients, commands, and utilities.</li>  
							<li>If the CSFSERV class is active, ensure that the z/OS KDC user ID and all user IDs that use Kerberos commands or Kerberized application running on the z/OS system have read access to the following ICSF resources: 
								<ul> 
									<li>When Kerberos is enabled for FIPS 140 mode: CSFRNG, CSFOWH, CSF1TRC, CSF1TRD, CSF1SKD, and CSF1SKE</li>  
									<li>When Kerberos is not enabled for FIPS 140 mode: CSFRNG and CSFOWH</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>For the UNIX System Services Telnet server, the KDC user ID is the user ID under which the otelnetd 
									<code>-a user</code> or 
									<code>-a valid</code> command is started.
								</p>  
								<p>For the FTP server that is configured with the EXTENSIONS AUTH_GSSAPI parameter, the KDC user ID is the user ID under which the FTP server runs.</p>  
								<p>For FTP clients, the KDC user ID is any user ID that starts the FTP client command or API with the -a GSSAPI or -r GSSAPI parameter or that starts the FTP client with the SECURE_MECHANISM GSSAPI parameter specified in their FTP.DATA data sets.</p>  
								<p>For the UNIX System Services RSH server, the KDC user ID is the user ID under which the orshd -k KRB5 or -k GSSAPI command is issued.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>The default encryption types for Kerberos applications have changed from DES encryption types to stronger encryption types, AES and 3DES. If the former default encryption types are still required, they must be explicitly set in the Kerberos configuration files, /etc/skrb/krb5.conf by default, by issuing the following commands: 
								<p>default_tgs_enctypes = des-cbc-crc,des-cbc-md5</p>  
								<p>default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-crc,des-cbc-md5</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>The default checksum types for Kerberos applications have changed from obsolete checksum types to more modern and secure checksum types. If the former defaults values are still required, they must be explicitly set in the Kerberos configuration files, /etc/skrb/krb5.conf by default, by issuing the following commands: 
								<p>ap_req_checksum_type = rsa-md5</p>  
								<p>kdc_req_checksum_type = rsa-md5</p>  
								<p>safe_checksum_type = rsa-md5-des</p>

							<strong>FTP client and FTP server</strong> 
						</p>  
						<p>When the FTP client or server is configured with TLSMECHANISM ATTLS in the FTP.DATA data set, then AT-TLS is being used to provide the TLS/SSL protection, so you should refer to the AT-TLS instructions above.</p>  
						<p>When the FTP client or server is configured with TLSMECHANISM FTP, then FTP will call System SSL directly. In this case, you can configure a specific set of ciphers by coding the CIPHERSUITE parameter in the FTP.DATA data set.</p> Note: 
						<p>SSL V2 is not supported when the FTP client or server is configured with TLSMECHANISM FTP, so there are no SSL V2 considerations in this case.</p>  
						<p> 
							<strong>TN3270E Telnet server</strong> 
						</p>  
						<p>When the TN3270E Telnet server is configured with TTLSPORT in the Telnet profile, then AT-TLS is being used to provide the TLS/SSL protection, so you should refer to the AT-TLS instructions above.</p>

							<dd>You can configure a specific set of ciphers by coding the ENCRYPTION statement of the Telnet profile.</dd>  
							<dt>SSL V2 ciphers</dt>  
							<dd>Since the use of SSL V2 is not recommended due to known weaknesses, the TN3270 Telnet server disables SSL V2 by default. If you choose to enable SSL V2 by specifying the SSLV2 parameter in the Telnet profile, then if the TN3270 secure connection is established using SSL V2, then the RC4-based ciphers ("1" and "2") will be included in the SSL V2 cipher set.</dd>

							<strong>Digital Certificate Access Server (DCAS)</strong>

							<dd>Since the use of SSL V2 is not recommended due to known weaknesses, DCAS disables SSL V2 by default. If you choose to enable SSL V2 (and SSL V3) by specifying TLSV1ONLY FALSE in the DCAS configuration file, then if the DCAS secure connection is established using SSL V2, then the RC4-based ciphers ("1" and "2") will be included in the SSL V2 cipher set.</dd>

						<p> 
							<strong>Policy Agent</strong> 
						</p>  
						<p>When the Policy Agent is configured with the DynamicConfigPolicyLoad statement in the main Pagent configuration file, it is acting as a policy server and can be protected using AT-TLS. In this case, you should refer to the AT-TLS instructions above.</p>  
						<p>When the Policy Agent is configured with the PolicyServer and ServerConnection statements, it is acting as a policy client. If the ServerSSL parameter is specified on the ServerConnection statement, the connection between the client and the remote policy server is protected by using System SSL directly. You can configure a specific set of ciphers by coding the ServerSSLV3CipherSuites parameter of the ServerConnection statement.</p> Note: 
						<p>SSL V2 is not supported when the Policy Agent is configured with the PolicyServer and ServerConnection statements, so there are no SSL V2 considerations in this case.</p>

					<title>System SSL: Ensure that System SSL applications meet minimum key sizes</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3, System SSL applications that are running FIPS mode using a Triple DES symmetric key for encryption, the key must meet minimum strength requirements. Also, for System SSL non-FIPS applications that are negotiating secure SSL/TLS connections, the minimum asymmetric key size is being increased for the peer's end entity certificate.</p>  
						<p>Specifically, System SSL is changed, as follows:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>For negotiating a secure connection in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode, and using the Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) algorithm to protect the connection or encrypt a Public Key Cryptography Standards #7 (PKCS #7) enveloped data message, the Triple DES key that is used to encrypt the data must meet the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirement that is stated in 
								<cite>Special Publication 800-131A</cite>. In short, each of the three parts in a Triple DES key must be unique. 
								<p>When System SSL is used to generate a Triple DES key, System SSL ensures that an appropriate key is generated. If a Triple DES key is supplied by the calling application outside of a SSL/TLS connection, the supplier of the application must ensure that the passed key meets the NIST Triple DES requirement.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>For negotiating a secure connection in non-FIPS mode, the minimum peer certificate key size for RSA, DSA, and DH certificates is increased from 512 bits to 1024 bits. For ECC certificates, the minimum key size is increased from 160 bits to 192 bits.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>For applications that use smaller ("weak") keys, evaluate each application's usage and change it to use a stronger key, if possible. For applications that must continue to use weak keys, you must explicitly enable support for the weak keys.</p>

If ICSF is unable to perform the RSA cryptographic operation, System SSL performs the cryptographic operation in its software implementation.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R3, z/OS System SSL is changing its default SSL and TLS cipher support to no longer include the DES, Triple DES and Fixed Diffie-Hellman ciphers.</p>  
						<p>A 
							<dfn>cipher</dfn> defines the authentication, encryption, message authentication code (MAC), and key exchange algorithm that is used when applications negotiate a secure connection by using SSL or TLS.
						</p>  
						<p>When a System SSL application calls the gsk_environment_open() routine to establish a secure environment, or the deprecated SSL or TLS gsk_secure_soc_init() routine specifying 
							<em>cipher_specs</em> or 
							<em>v3cipher_spec set</em> as NULL, the default enabled ciphers no longer include the ciphers that are listed in 
							<a class="xref" href="#SystemSSLModifyCodeOrSystemSSLnull__rmb1tab" title="SSL V3 and TLS ciphers">Table 179</a> and

If the application supports the use of environment variables, see Method 2 in this section for environment variable information.</p>  
						<p>If your System SSL written application needs to support one or more of the removed ciphers, z/OS System SSL provides two methods to override the default SSL/TLS ciphers that are enabled when negotiating a secure connection by using the SSL/TLS routines. Your application must use one of the following methods:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>Method 1</dt>  
							<dd>Use the gsk_attribute_set_buffer() or gsk_secure_soc_init() routine: 
								<dl> 
									<dt>gsk_attribute_set_buffer()</dt>  
									<dd>The gsk_attribute_set_buffer() routine supports the specification of SSL V2 and SSL V3/TLS ciphers in preference order through the GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS, GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS, and GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED attributes. Each attribute buffer consists of a single character string that consists of the cipher values enabled to be used for the secure connection. 
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V2 ciphers, specify the GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS attribute, along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in preference order.</p>  
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V3/TLS ciphers, specify GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS if 2-character cipher specifications are enabled (the default), or GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED if 4-character cipher specifications are enabled, along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in preference order.</p>  
										<p>For example, to restore the SSL V3/TLS 2-character default cipher list prior to the removal of the triple DES ciphers and DES ciphers 09, 0A, 12, 13, 15, and 16, set the GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECs buffer value to "3538392F32330A1613091512". The 4-character GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED buffer value would be "003500380039002F00320033000A00160013000900150012"</p> 
									</dd>  
									<dt>gsk_secure_soc_init()</dt>  
									<dd>The gsk_secure_soc_init() routine (deprecated API) supports the specification of SSL V2 and SSL V3/TLS ciphers through the 
										<em>cipher_specs</em> and 
										<em>v3cipher_specs</em> fields in the 
										<em>gsk_soc_init_data</em> structure. 
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V2 ciphers, specify the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in the 
											<em>cipher_specs</em> field in preference order.
										</p>  
										<p>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V3/TLS ciphers, specify the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in the 
											<em>v3cipher_specs</em> field in preference order.
										</p>  
										<p>For example, to restore the SSL V3/TLS default cipher list to contain triple DES and DES ciphers 09, 0A, 12, 13, 15, and 16, set the v3cipher_specs value to "3538392F32330A1613091512".</p> 
									</dd> 
								</dl> 
							</dd>  
							<dt>Method 2</dt>  
							<dd>Use the environment variables GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS, GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS, and GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED: 
								<dl> 
									<dt>GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS</dt>  
									<dd>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V2 ciphers, specify the GSK_V2_CIPHER_SPECS attribute along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in preference order.</dd>  
									<dt>GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS</dt>  
									<dd>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V3 ciphers, specify GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS, if 2-character cipher specifications are enabled (the default) along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in preference order. See Method 1 in this section for cipher specification list example.</dd>  
									<dt>GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED</dt>  
									<dd>To re-enable one or more of the SSL V3 ciphers, specify GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS_EXPANDED, if 4-character cipher specifications are enabled along with the complete list of ciphers to be available during the negotiation of the secure connection in preference order. See Method 1 in this section for cipher specification list example.</dd> 
								</dl>

					<title>System SSL: Determine whether to re-enable the MD5 with RSA algorithm in the defaults list</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R3, z/OS System SSL changed its default hash and signature algorithm support. Specifically, System SSL removed MD5 with RSA ("0101") from the default list of client and server hash and signature algorithm pairs. This list is used to determine the certificate signing algorithm for applications that negotiate a secure connection by using a TLS V1.2 handshake.</p>  
						<p>As a result of this change, when a System SSL application calls the gsk_environment_open() routine to establish a secure environment, the default hash and signature algorithm pairs list no longer includes the MD5 with RSA signature algorithm.</p>  
						<p>The MD5 with RSA ("0101") hash and signature algorithm pair was available in non-FIPS mode only.</p>  
						<p>If an SSL application or its connection partner uses certificates that are signed with the MD5 with RSA algorithm, the connection might fail because MD5 with RSA is no longer included in the hash and signature algorithms pairs list. These certificates include not only the end entity certificate, but also any signing certificates in the certificate chain.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>If your installation or System SSL applications do not enable TLS V1.2 at either the connection or environment level, you have no action to take. Also, if your System SSL applications are enabled for FIPS, you have no action to take because MD5 with RSA is not supported in FIPS.</p>  
						<p>If your System SSL applications use secure TLS V1.2 connections, examine the applications to determine whether they require MD5 with RSA certificates. If so, you must explicitly enable the MD5 with RSA signature algorithm. Or, you must modify the applications to use certificates that use alternative signature algorithms.</p>  
						<p>System SSL supports a wide range of signature algorithms that provide a higher level of security than MD5 with RSA. For information about the System SSL supported signature algorithms pairs, see the table of signature algorithm pair definitions for TLS in 
							<cite>Appendix C</cite> of

								<cite>z/OS Cryptographic Services System SSL Programming</cite> 
							</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>If your System SSL applications must continue to use MD5 with RSA certificates, z/OS System SSL provides two methods for overriding the default list of signature algorithms. Your application must use one of the following methods:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>Use the gsk_attribute_set_buffer() routine.</dt>  
							<dd>Use the gsk_attribute_set_buffer() routine to specify the hash and signature algorithm pairs list. Each attribute buffer consists of a single character string that indicates the algorithms that are enabled for use with a secure connection. 
								<p>To re-enable the MD5 with RSA signature algorithm, enter the command gsk_attribute_set_buffer() with the attribute GSK_TLS_SIG_ALG_PAIRS and the complete list of available algorithms, including 
									<code>"0101"</code>.
								</p>  
								<p>For example:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>To restore the previous V2R1 and V2R2 default hash and signature algorithms, which includes MD5 with RSA ("0101"), set the buffer to 
										<code>"0601060305010503040104030402030103030302020102030202

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R4, the PKI Services component of z/OS uses the HTTPS protocol for its web page interfaces. In previous releases, PKI Services presented the first web page by using the HTTP protocol. Doing so allowed the user to use the link on this page to download the certificate authority (CA) root certificate of the web server certificate into the web browser. Thereafter, all the subsequent web pages used HTTPS.</p>  
						<p>To help ensure strong security, web pages should use HTTPS rather than HTTP. To use HTTPS, the CA root certificate of the web server must be preinstalled in the user’s web browser.</p>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R4, the PKI page that previously used HTTP is now updated to use HTTPS. The link that is used to deliver the CA root certificate on the first page is removed. Therefore, you must use an alternative method to distribute the CA root certificate to the appropriate users at your installation.</p>

						<p>You can code the new CTRACE option within a BEGIN(HCR77A1) END option pair in a options data set shared between multiple releases of ICSF.</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>If you share the installation options data set between HCR77A1 and pre-HCR77A1 systems, you can continue to supply the TRACEENTRY option at the lower-level systems as it is ignored, and processing will continue on the HCR77A1 systems.</li>  
							<li>If your installation cannot tolerate the CSFO0212 message that is issued at startup, you need to use different installation option data sets. Note that new CTRACE options will be in effect: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Review the default CTRACE options to ensure that they are satisfactory for your system.</li>  
									<li>Make any necessary changes. Use the CTICSF00 PARMLIB to create customized ICSF CTRACE Configuration Data Sets in PARMLIB. You can use the new CTRACE option to specify the customized ICSF CTRACE Configuration Data Set in the ICSF Options Data Set. 
										<p>For example, you can specify 
											<code>CTRACE(CTICSFxx)</code>, where xx is any two characters that were used when copying the default CTICSF00 parmlib member.
										</p>  
										<p>Component tracing is active when ICSF starts using the trace options defined in the CTICSFxx PARMLIB member, where 00 is the default. If the CTICSF00 PARMLIB member is incorrect or missing, ICSF CTRACE performs tracing using an internal default set of trace options. The operator can specify trace options individually on the TRACE CT command or specify the name of a CTICSFxx PARMLIB member containing the desired trace options. Using a PARMLIB member on the TRACE CT command can help minimize operator intervention and avoid syntax or keystroke errors</p>

					<title>DFSMSdfp: Back up SMS control data sets</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In a multisystem Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) complex, operating systems share a common set of SMS classes, groups, ACS routines, and a configuration base, which make up the storage management policy for the complex. This storage management policy is maintained in a source control data set (SCDS). When this policy is activated for SMS, the bound policy is maintained in processor storage and on DASD in an active control data set (ACDS). Systems in the complex communicate SMS information through a common communications data set (COMMDS).</p>  
						<p>It is recommended that to successfully share SMS control data sets in a multisystem environment where there are mixed levels of DFSMS, you update, translate, validate, and activate SMS policies on the system with the latest level of DFSMS. When an earlier control data set is to be updated or activated, the control data set is formatted by the later-level system. The shared SMS control blocks reflect the new, rather than the previous, lengths and control information.</p>  
						<p>For fallback, IBM recommends restoring SMS control data sets from backups taken on the fallback release.</p>  
						<p>Editing a policy on an earlier system could invalidate unused control information and prevent the control data set from being accessed by a later system. A warning message is provided before a policy can be changed on an earlier system. ACS routines may need to be updated and translated so to not reference policy items not known to the earlier system.</p>  
						<p>Remember, you risk policy activation failures if SCDS changes are not validated using the latest-level system in a sysplex.</p>

					<title>DFSMSdfp: Consider replacing the SDM TSO commands with REXX</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>IBM previously announced in 
							<cite>Software Announcement 215-267</cite>, dated July 28, 2015, that z/OS V2R2 would be the last release to include a number of System Data Mover (SDM) TSO/E commands. Based on client feedback, IBM now intends to continue to support these commands in the future, including the query and XSET commands. However, IBM plans no future enhancements for them. IBM recommends that you use the equivalent REXX versions of these commands instead, which are intended to be updated as needed to support any new functions in the future.
						</p>  
						<p>Specifically, the following commands were planned to be removed, but now remain in support:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>FCESTABL</li>  
							<li>FCWITHDR</li>  
							<li>CDELPAIR</li>  
							<li>CDELPATH</li>

						<p>Evaluate whether to convert your existing non-query TSO commands to their REXX equivalents. To help you do so, IBM provides the following conversion programs in SYS1.DGTCLIB:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>ANTFREXX for FlashCopy</li>

						</ul>  
						<p>Some of the TSO command keywords differ slightly from the REXX versions, and might need to be modified. For example, for full volume FlashCopy establish, you might enter the TSO command, as follows:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>FCESTABL SDEVN(0F60) TDEVN(0F61)</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>To use the REXX interface, you can enter:</p>

						<p>In z/OS V2R4, the default target for DFSMShsm automatic migration is changed from both classic and cloud object storage to just classic migration. To have DFSMShsm data sets automatically migrated to cloud object storage, you must enable this processing.</p>  
						<p>Automatic migration to the cloud object storage was introduced in DFSMS SPE APAR OA52901, which was provided for z/OS V2R2 and z/OS V2R3. Initially, this function was enabled by default.</p>  
						<p>In addition, as of z/OS V2R4, the DFSMShsm command SETSYS MIGRATIONAUTOCLOUD(ALLCLOUDONLYNOCLOUD) is updated to allow you to specify that only a subset of DFSMShsm hosts are to process cloud migrations. Initially, the command defaulted to 
							<code>ALL</code>, which indicates that both cloud and classic migrations are to be processed. In z/OS V2R4, the command default is changed to 
							<code>NOCLOUD</code>, to prevent cloud migrations from impacting classic migration windows.

						<p>The VVDS is a VSAM entry-sequenced data set that contains information about the VSAM and SMS-managed non-VSAM data sets residing on the volume with the VVDS. The first logical record in a VVDS is the VSAM volume control record (VVCR). It contains information for management of DASD space and the BCS names, which have VSAM or SMS-managed non-VSAM data sets on the volume.</p>  
						<p>When a user catalog is opened, if a catalog name cannot be found in the VVCR record within the VVDS on a volume that is referenced by the master catalog CONNECTORE RECORD (U), the VVDS manager issues error code 050-020 and message IEC161I.</p>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3, or z/OS V2R2 with APARs OA50937 and OA52118 applied, a dynamic dump is taken with message IEC161I if a catalog name is not found in the VVCR record within the VVDS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS data set encryption, through SAF controls and RACF® or equivalent function along with SMS policies, allows you to identify new data sets or groups of data sets to be encrypted. With data set encryption, you are able to protect data on disk from being viewed by unauthorized users. For more information about data set encryption, see 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.idai200/abstract.htm">z/OS DFSMS Access Method Services Commands</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>You must ensure that encrypted data sets are not created until your installation is ready to encrypt and decrypt. Until the decryption functions are available on all sharing systems (including backup systems and disaster recovery systems), encrypted data sets will be inaccessible to systems that cannot decrypt the data.</p>  
						<p>Because data set encryption has both hardware and software requirements, you must consider all systems that share data with a system on which you plan to enable data set encryption. For this discussion, 
							<dfn>all systems in your configuration</dfn> means all systems that have access, or might have access (for example, in backup mode) to the same encrypted data sets.

							<li>Backup systems</li>  
							<li>Read-only systems</li>

						<p>The PTFs for APAR OA50569 can be applied in a rolling IPL. However, to avoid unpredictable results such as data set corruption, the PTFs must be IPLed on all systems in your configuration prior to creating any encrypted data sets. If your configuration includes a z/OS V2R3 system, the PTFs for APAR OA50569 must be applied and IPLed on all systems in your configuration. If testing is to begin prior to this rollout, ensure that strict data set security measures are implemented to prevent access from a system that has not been IPLed with the PTFs for APAR OA50569.</p>  
						<p>To control the creation of encrypted data sets and prevent loss of access to data on any system that does not have the support, follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Restrict access to the SAF FACILITY class resource STGADMIN.SMS.ALLOW.DATASET.ENCRYPT until all systems in your installation have installed the PTFs for OA50569 and satisfy the minimum hardware requirements. On a system with RACF as the security manager, you can define the STGADMIN.SMS.ALLOW.DATASET.ENCRYPT profile in the FACILITY class, and set the universal access to NONE: 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE FACILITY STGADMIN.SMS.ALLOW.DATASET.ENCRYPT UACC(NONE)</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>If the SAF FIELD class is active, check for any profile that would allow any user without SPECIAL attribute access to the DATASET.DFP.DATAKEY. If there are none, no additional action is needed. If there is any profile that would allow access to DATASET.DFP.DATAKEY, create a DATASET.DFP.DATAKEY profile in the FIELD class with a UACC of NONE: 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE FIELD DATASET.DFP.DATAKEY UACC(NONE)</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>Do not create DATASET profiles with the KEYLABEL field in the DFP segment until all systems in your installation meet all of the software and hardware minimum requirements. Carefully follow the instructions in

						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R4, your programs must close PDSE data sets before these data sets are overwritten by a DFSMSdss COPY or RESTORE operation. Otherwise, the DFSMSdss COPY or RESTORE operation encounters serialization errors, such as an ADR412E.</p> Note:

						<p>For programs that cannot close the PDSE data sets while a COPY or RESTORE operation is in progress, these programs can specify the TOLERATE(ENQFAILURE) keyword.

							<code>DATACLAS</code>, which indicates that both SMS-managed and non-SMS-managed KSDS data sets use the CA reclaim attribute in the data class, which you set with ISMF. The attribute is set to 
							<code>Yes</code> to enable CA reclaim by default.
						</p>  
						<p>In previous releases, the default was

						<p>For efficient DASD space usage, IBM recommends that you run your system with CA reclaim enabled.</p>  
						<p>CA reclaim can provide for improved DASD space usage, but it requires more I/O to track the reclaimed CAs so that they can be reused. The cost of this I/O might not be justified if there are no or few CA splits to reuse empty CAs. To determine whether CA reclaim is desirable for a data set, use the EXAMINE DATASET command, which shows the number of empty CAs in a KSDS with message IDC01728I.</p>  
						<p>If you do not want the default 
							<code>CA_RECLAIM(DATACLAS)</code>, you can override it by specifying 
							<code>CA_RECLAIM(NONE)</code> in your IGDSMSxx parmlib member. With the DATACLAS setting, you can disable or enable CA reclaim at the data class level. You can also disable or enable the CA reclaim setting for specific data sets by using the command IDCAMS ALTER ksds_name RECLAIMCA NORECLAIMCA.
						</p>  
						<p>After IPL, you can dynamically change the CA_RECLAIM setting by using the SETSMS command.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R2 (with APAR OA49981) and z/OS V2R1 (with APAR OA42679), IDCAMS is changed in the way that it starts TSO/E to allocate a data set.</p>  
						<p>IDCAMS processing now uses the TSO/E Service Facility (TSF) to allocate a data set, rather than running the ALLOCATE command under the TSO/E terminal monitor program (IKJEFT01). With this change, the user ID assigned to the IDCAMS batch job is treated as the default data set prefix. That is, the user ID for the IDCAMS batch job is appended to the data set name as a high-level qualifier, if you specify the data set name on the DATASET keyword without quotation marks and the user ID does not have a RACF TSO segment.</p>  
						<p>Previously, the IDCAMS ALLOCATE command used a null prefix for the allocated data set, if you specified the data set name on the DATASET keyword without quotation marks and the user ID did not have a RACF TSO segment.</p>  
						<p>Assume, for example, that the user ID ZZZZZZZ is defined in both UADS and in RACF without a TSO segment; note the following differences in behavior:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Before this change, TSO runs under the UADS user. If the data set name is specified without quotation marks on the DATASET keyword, and the user has a UADS PROFILE PREFIX(prefix), the prefix is used as the data set prefix. Otherwise, the user ID is used as the data set prefix.</li>  
							<li>After this change, the user ID is always used as the data set prefix. Therefore, if the user ID and UADS PROFILE PREFIX(prefix) are different, the high-level qualifier for the data set is changed.</li>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R3, the LEVEL request type of the ANTRQST macro is changed in how it indicates the level of support that is available. These changes affect assembler programs that use the LEVEL request to determine whether a function of ANTRQST can be used.</p>  
						<p>Without this enhancement, LEVEL returns a single numeric value for each ILK (XRC, PPRC, ESSRVCS, or MAIN) in the first 4 bytes of the RETINFO field. This numeric value is cumulative. For example, level 2 supports all of the function of level 1 plus the new function in level 2. This approach can create a problem when some functions are introduced in the service stream for all z/OS release levels, and some functions are introduced for a specific release only.</p>  
						<p>With this enhancement, a new mapping macro, ANTFEAT, is added, which contains a bit map of all supported ANTRQST functions. ANTFEAT maps the results that ANTRQST returns in the 100-byte RETINFO field. The first 4 bytes of RETINFO, which previously designated the level, are preserved for compatibility. A new value of 200 (a value that is greater than the current level for all ILK functions) is returned. This is done for compatibility for any users that are still using the single numeric LEVEL value rather than the new feature code bit map in ANTFEAT. It also allows users of the new function to know whether ANTFEAT is returning the bit map: A value less than 200 indicates that ANTFEAT is not supported. The new DSECT data that contains the feature codes, which are mapped by ANTFEAT, follows the first 4 bytes in the RETINFO field.</p>

					<title>DFS/SMB: Use Network File System (NFS) instead of DFS/SMB</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R4, the z/OS operating system no longer supports Distributed File System / Server Message Block (DFS/SMB). Originally, the z/OS Distributed File Service base element consisted of two components: SMB and z/OS File System (zFS). In z/OS V2R4, the name of the base element is changed to z/OS File System.</p>  
						<p>If you need to share files between z/OS and Microsoft Windows, IBM recommends that you use the Network File System (NFS) protocol instead of DFS/SMB. NFS also allows for the sharing of z/OS data with UNIX and Linux systems.</p>  
						<p>NFS is the strategic file sharing protocol for the z/OS platform. To help your installation upgrade to NFS, IBM plans to deliver new NFS function on existing levels of the operating system, including installation, security, availability, and operational enhancements. These planned enhancements are intended to help you more easily migrate to NFS before you upgrade to the next release of z/OS.</p>

					<title>HCD: Accommodate the removal of switch functions from Tivoli System Automation</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>With the I/O operations component (I/O Ops) of Tivoli System Automation (TSA) reaching its end of service date in September 2019, HCD has withdrawn support for I/O Ops, as of z/OS V2R4. The I/O Ops component is removed from TSA in Release 4.1, as stated in 
							<cite>IBM United States Software Announcement 217-086</cite>, dated February 28, 2018. With this change, HCD and HCM no longer support the I/O Ops component, as of z/OS V2R4.
						</p>  
						<p>The changes for HCM are described in 
							<a class="xref" href="#unique_331725219">HCM: Accommodate the removal of I/O Operations from Tivoli System Automation</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>In previous releases, HCD used the I/O Ops component for importing, exporting, definition, and activation of switch configurations, and for gathering input for the HCD I/O Path report. Withdrawing the I/O Ops support in HCD means that HCD no longer supports importing, exporting, or activating switch configurations. The corresponding HCD actions — 2.8, 2.9, and 5.2 — are removed from HCD.</p>  
						<p>Though it is still possible to define switches and switch configurations in HCD, the switch information in the IODF can become out of sync with information in the switch itself. Therefore, it is recommended that you stop using the switch configuration information in HCD.</p> Note: 
						<p>More recent FICON switches are configured within the switches themselves.</p>  
						<p>With the removal of the support for I/O Ops, HCD no longer uses I/O Ops for gathering information for the I/O Path report, which remains available in HCD. HCD can provide similar function by using IBM Z Discovery and Auto-Configuration (zDAC), if zDAC is enabled on your system. Otherwise, if zDAC is not enabled, the HCD I/O Path report includes information from the IODF only. Be aware that zDAC dynamically defines temporary devices to be able to perform discovery.</p>  
						<p>A limitation of zDAC is that status information is available only for paths that are accessible from the local sysplex. If you currently run HCD and TSA I/O Ops for the I/O Path report, in z/OS V2R4, you must run the report on all z/OS sysplexes and then combine this information manually. Or, you can run the report on a system that has access to all of the paths that are of interest.</p>  
						<p>This change also means that the message CBDG129I is no longer displayed if an I/O Path report is requested and I/O Ops is not available.</p>  
						<p>HCM continues to show the I/O Path report as generated by HCD.</p>

						<p>If you are using the I/O Path report, enable zDAC on the system where you run the report. To do so, you must authorize the LPAR that is running HCD to make dynamic I/O configuration changes. In addition, the user running the report needs to be authorized to make dynamic I/O configuration changes. This activity requires UPDATE authority to the MVS.ACTIVATE profile in the OPERCMDS class. For more details on zDAC and how to enable it, see 
							<cite>HCD User's Guide</cite>.
						</p>  
						<p>Determine whether you are running the HCD I/O Path report. If so, do the following:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Define, export, and activate switch configurations by using a previous version of HCD. It is recommended that you remove switch configuration information from your IODF.</li>  
							<li>Replace your I/O Path report that used TSA I/O OPS with I/O Path reports that use zDAC.</li>

							<li>Retrieving, manipulating, and activating switch matrices</li>  
							<li>Issuing I/O Operation commands.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>With this change, the corresponding functions are removed from HCM. Specifically, the functions are removed from the HCM Operations menu and the actions that are listed for View

					<title>HLASM: Verify that the changed default of ILMA is acceptable</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Before HLASM APAR PI74470, if the active instruction set was switched during an assembly by using the ACONTROL OPTABLE, any previously defined macros were no longer visible, as they were only added to the current OPTABLE set. For SYSLIB macros, this behavior is harmless (though inefficient) because a new copy of the macro is fetched. However, for inline macros, this behavior causes errors because the macro becomes undefined.</p>  
						<p>To help avoid this problem, APAR PI97142 adds the option ILMA, which prevents this problem by causing inline macros to be defined in all OPTABLEs. The ILMA option was required to be explicitly specified to override the default NOILMA.</p>  
						<p>With APAR PI98655, the keyword value ILMA=YES is now included in the default options module ASMADOPT and the macro ASMAOPT, which is used to generate ASMADOPT.</p>  
						<p>This default change is unlikely to affect any but a few assembly language programs.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R3, and earlier releases with APAR PI71827 applied, you no longer need to define IEV90 as an alias of ASMA90. HLASM now includes the ALIAS IEV90 statement in the JCLIN for HMQ4160J, which means that an alias for ASMA90 is automatically created.</p>  
						<p>Programs that invoke ASMA90 through the name IEV90 will continue to work.</p>  
						<p>In previous releases, to ease the migration of assembler procedures from Assembler H (IEV90) to High Level Assembler (ASMA90), your installation might have defined IEV90 as an alias of ASMA90. Your installation could use the ASMAIEV sample usermod in the ASM.SASMSAM1 library to enable the alias, until you finished updating the references. IBM supplies module ASMAIEV in data set ASM.SASMSAM1. In the sample, ASMAIEV has a usermod name of ML00009.</p>

					<title>IBM Knowledge Center uses /global by default</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R3, IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS (KC4z) uses the new /global directory for KC product documentation content and associated properties files. This directory, which is available in the version root and sysplex root, can be used to store and maintain a single copy of KC4z data (KC product documentation content and associated properties files) that can be referenced by all members of the sysplex. Before V2R3, individual copies of the same KC4z data had to be maintained in each member of the sysplex.</p>  
						<p>With this change, the directory structure that is created by the KC4z 1.1 post-installation configuration scripts is changed to use the /global directory. As a result, a single copy of KC product content and associated properties files can be shared across all systems in a sysplex that use shared file system support. The entire post-installation directory structure is changed, so migration considerations, when applicable, apply to both sysplex and single system environments.</p>  
						<p>Following is the default tree structure that is created by the original KC4z 1.0 (z/OS V2R2) post-installation scripts. The /sharedapps/kc4z/servers/,/sharedapps/kc4z/data/, and /var/kc4z directories are mount points that are created by the first post-installation script. Then, sample JCL jobs are used to create Server Configuration (HKCCFGFZ), Data (HKCDATFZ) and Logs (HKCLOGFZ) file systems, and mount them on those three mount points. More scripts then create the subdirectories on the mounted file systems, and populate the server configuration subdirectory.</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>/sharedapps/kc4z/servers/kc4zServer /sharedapps/kc4z/data/conf /sharedapps/kc4z/data/content /sharedapps/kc4z/data/runtime/index /sharedapps/kc4z/data/runtime/diskcache /sharedapps/kc4z/data/runtime/datacache /var/kc4z/logs</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>Following, is the default tree structure that is created by the KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3) post-installation scripts. The /global/kc4z/data/, /var/kc4z/runtime/, and /var/kc4z/ logs directories are mount points that are created by the first post-installation script. Then, sample JCL jobs are used to create Data (HKCDATFZ), Runtime (HKCRUNFZ) and Logs (HKCLOGFZ) file systems, and mount them on those three mount points. More scripts then create the subdirectories on the file systems, and populate the server configuration subdirectory. For KC4z 1.1, the Runtime file system (HKCRUNFZ) is new; because the server configuration files are now stored in the /etc/ file system, a Server Configuration file system (HKCCFGFZ) is no longer created and mounted.</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>/etc/kc4z/servers/kc4zServer /global/kc4z/data/conf /global/kc4z/data/content /var/kc4z/runtime/index /var/kc4z/runtime/diskcache /var/kc4z/runtime/datacache /var/kc4z/logs</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>Notice that the /global/kc4z/data/ mount point is created under the /global directory that is in effect for a given system. In a sysplex, for a system using shared file system support, that would be the /global directory in the sysplex root file system, and for a system not using shared file system support in the sysplex, that would be the /global directory in the version file system. In a non-sysplex, that would be the /global directory in the root file system. Regardless of location, the HKCDATFZ file system is mounted on the /global/kc4z/data mount point, and the /global/kc4z/data/conf and /global/kc4z/data/content subdirectories are then created there by subsequent post-installation scripts.</p>

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Before you run any KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3) post-installation scripts and sample JCL jobs, make a backup copy of the KC4z 1.0 (z/OS V2R2) data file systems (data set name HKC.HKCDATFZ, by default), and logs file systems (data set name HKC.HKCLOGFZ, by default). Only data file systems (HKCDATFZ) can be migrated from KC4z 1.0 (z/OS V2R2) to KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3). Backup copies of the KC4z 1.0 Logs file systems can be used for archive purposes only. Regardless, unless backed up, the KC4z 1.0 Data and Logs file system data sets can (if unmounted) be overwritten by the KC4z 1.1 sample JCL jobs, by default.</p>  
						<p>After you run the newly documented KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3) post-installation scripts and sample JCL jobs, if it is desired to migrate a backup copy of a KC4z 1.0 (z/OS V2R2) Data file system for use with KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3), unmount the newly created Data file system (HKCDATFZ) from the /global/kc4z/data mount point directory. Then, mount the desired backup copy of the KC4z 1.0 Data file system (HKCDATFZ) in its place.</p>  
						<p>After doing so:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Inspect the “path=” value within each *.properties file in the /global/kc4z/data/conf directory. For any *.properties files in which the prefix of the “path=” value is “ /sharedapps/kc4z/data” manually edit that prefix to reflect the new mount point of “ /global/kc4z/data”. The *.properties files are in the ASCII code page, and should remain in that code page.</li>  
							<li>Remove the runtime directory (/global/kc4z/data/runtime) and its subdirectories. These old runtime directories are no longer needed, as the new runtime directories are in a separate runtime file system (HKCRUNFZ) for KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3). The old runtime data cannot be migrated from KC4z 1.0 (z/OS V2R2) to KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3).</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>In a z/OS V2R3 sysplex, if the Data file system is mounted at /global/kc4z/data in the sysplex root, it is shareable by all KC4Z server instances in the sysplex running on systems that use shared file system support. Because KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V2R3) servers, by default, are pre-configured to read data from the Data file system that is mounted at /global/kc4z/data, such a KC4z 1.1 (z/OS V3R3) server would automatically use the shared copy in the sysplex root. Any older such KC4Z 1.0 (z/OS V2R2) servers in the sysplex can also be made to read the data in the shared Data file system that is mounted at /global/kc4z/data in the sysplex root by editing their /sharedapps/kc4z/servers/kc4zServer/kc.properties file to replace the conf.path= “ /sharedapps/kc4z/data/conf” value with “ /global/kc4z/data/conf”.</p>  
						<p>After all post-installation configuration steps and upgrade actions are complete, each instance of the KC4z server (hkcsvr1) should be started according to the documented instructions in 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.hkcz100/abstract.htm">IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS Configuration and User Guide</a>.

					<title>Prepare for z/OSMF autostart</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R3, the base element z/OSMF is started by default at system IPL. This enhancement, which is referred to as 
							<dfn>z/OSMF autostart</dfn>, means that z/OSMF is available for use as soon as the system is up.
						</p>  
						<p>For new z/OSMF installations, this change means that z/OSMF is active by default. The element is available for your use after you enable the required security authorizations. For existing z/OSMF installations, this change means that it is no longer necessary for you to explicitly start the z/OSMF server after each system IPL, whether through automation or operator commands entered manually at the console.</p>  
						<p>The autostart function introduces a set of upgrade actions that affect all z/OS installations. The upgrade actions are different, depending on whether your installation is new to z/OSMF or is already using this element. Installations that currently use z/OSMF meet most of the requirements already, and thus have fewer changes to make.</p>  
						<p>It is recommended that you perform the upgrade actions in three phases, as follows:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li> 
								<strong>Planning.</strong> To prepare for z/OSMF autostart, plan for how to deploy z/OSMF in your sysplex. For a sysplex, determine how many systems will run a z/OSMF server. Generally, it is sufficient to have one z/OSMF server active in a sysplex or monoplex, but you might choose to have more. A number of multi-system scenarios are supported. Deploying z/OSMF in a sysplex involves making updates to system libraries and your security management product, such as RACF. The planning considerations are described in 
								<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForAlwaysOn__IzuPlanningSteps">Steps to take</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>Security product updates.</strong> Your external security manager, such as RACF, requires a significant number of updates. The changes are needed to protect the resources that are used by z/OSMF, and to grant users access to the z/OSMF core functions. The steps are described in the upgrade action 
								<a class="xref" href="#izu_CreateSecurityForAlwaysOn">Create security authorizations for z/OSMF</a>.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<strong>System library updates.</strong> To accommodate z/OSMF autostart, you might need to modify settings in proclib and parmlib. The changes are needed to establish an autostart group for z/OSMF operations in your sysplex. The steps are described in the upgrade action 
								<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForMultiple">Define one or more z/OSMF autostart groups</a>.
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>If you choose not to have z/OSMF started automatically during IPL, you must explicitly disable the autostart function. Details for doing so are provided in 
							<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForAlwaysOn__IzuPlanningSteps">Steps to take</a>.

						<p>To prepare for z/OSMF autostart, follow the steps that are described in this section.</p>  
						<p>For ServerPac users, the ServerPac configuration process performs the upgrade actions that are needed to establish a base z/OSMF configuration on the target system. You can use the jobs and documentation in your ServerPac order to create an initial instance of z/OSMF on your z/OS V2R4 system.</p>  
						<p>Installations that install z/OSMF from a Custom-Built Product Delivery Option (CBPDO) software delivery package, or from a ServerPac order by using the software upgrade method of installation, must perform the steps that are described in this section. The upgrade actions are different, depending on whether your installation currently uses z/OSMF.</p>  
						<strong>For a new z/OSMF installation</strong> : 
						<ul> 
							<li>Understand the functions and usage requirements of z/OSMF. See the IBM website 
								<a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/zosmf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">z/OS Management Facility home page</a>.
							</li>  
							<li>Ensure that the target system satisfies the minimum memory requirements. The z/OSMF server requires a minimum of 4 GB of system memory to be configured.</li>  
							<li>To make the best use of the z/OSMF autostart capability, plan to deploy one or more autostarted z/OSMF servers in your environment. Generally, having one z/OSMF server active in a sysplex or monoplex is sufficient, but you might choose to have more, based on your workload requirements. The goal is to ensure that at least one z/OSMF server is always active in your environment. 
								<p>For a monoplex, little or no planning is needed. The z/OSMF server is started when you IPL the system. Or, if you do not want to use the autostart capability, you can disable it, as described in 
									<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForMultiple">Define one or more z/OSMF autostart groups</a>.
								</p>  
								<p>For a sysplex, more planning is required. You can choose to have one z/OSMF server autostart on a particular system and be used by the other systems in the sysplex. Or, you can select a subset of systems, or several subsets, and associate each subset with a specific z/OSMF server within an autostart group.</p>  
								<p>The set of systems that is served by an autostarted server is known as the 
									<dfn>autostart group</dfn>. z/OSMF includes one autostart group by default. To have more z/OSMF servers autostarted in a sysplex, you must associate each server—and the systems it serves—with a unique autostart group name.
								</p>  
								<p>In your planning, you must decide:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>What are the autostart groups in your sysplex.</li>  
									<li>Which systems autostart a z/OSMF server.</li>  
									<li>Which systems share the use of the autostarted server. These systems must be defined to the same autostart group as the system on which the autostarted server is running.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>Only one z/OSMF server can be active per autostart group in the sysplex. An autostarted z/OSMF server holds an enqueue on the z/OSMF user directory file system, and handles the z/OSMF requests from other systems that are connected to the same autostart group. Based on your planning, you can enable the desired number of z/OSMF autostart groups for your sysplex.</p>  
								<p>Before installing z/OS V2R4, see the following publication for planning and setup considerations: 
									<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izua300/abstract.htm">IBM z/OS Management Facility Configuration Guide</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>After you install z/OS V2R4, but before you IPL the system, complete the following upgrade actions: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Update your security management product, as described in 
										<a class="xref" href="#izu_CreateSecurityForAlwaysOn">Create security authorizations for z/OSMF</a>. This action can be done before you install z/OS V2R4, if you add the authorizations to your security database manually, rather than by running the IBM-supplied job in the z/OSMF V2R4 level of SYS1.SAMPLIB (IZUSEC).
									</li>  
									<li>Update system libraries, as described in 
										<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForMultiple">Define one or more z/OSMF autostart groups</a>.
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<strong>For an existing z/OSMF installation</strong> : 
						<ul> 
							<li>Review your plans for updating system libraries.</li>  
							<li>Review your plans for updating the security management product with your security administrator.</li>  
							<li>After you install z/OS V2R4, but before you IPL the system, you must complete the following upgrade actions: 
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<a class="xref" href="#izu_CreateSecurityForAlwaysOn">Create security authorizations for z/OSMF</a> . This action can be done before you install z/OS V2R4, if you add the authorizations to your security database manually, rather than by running the IBM-supplied job in SYS1.SAMPLIB (IZUSEC).
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForMultiple">Define one or more z/OSMF autostart groups</a> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p> 
							<strong>If you prefer not to have z/OSMF started automatically during IPL</strong>: You can disable the autostart function. For instructions on disabling the autostart function, see 
							<a class="xref" href="#izu_PrepareForMultiple">Define one or more z/OSMF autostart groups</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>If you disable autostart, be aware that the JES2 Email Delivery Services (EDS) function in z/OS requires an autostarted z/OSMF server to be up and running on at least one system in the sysplex. Otherwise, JES2 cannot send e-mail notifications to users who submit jobs. For information about configuring JES2 EDS, see the topic

					<title>z/OSMF: Establish security for cross-site z/OSMF REST requests</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OSMF includes a number of Representational State Transfer (REST) services, which are public APIs that an application can use to work with z/OS system resources and extract system data. The z/OSMF REST services are described in 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izua700/abstract.htm">IBM z/OS Management Facility Programming Guide</a>.
						</p>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R3:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>New HTTP custom header "X-CSRF-ZOSMF-HEADER" is required for all applications that issue cross-site requests to z/OSMF REST interfaces (both browser and non-browser applications). Further, for browser applications, the approved origin sites must be defined to your installation security "white list," as in previous releases.</li>  
							<li>z/OSMF server supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in your enterprise. With this support, a web browser can issue REST requests to the z/OSMF server on your system without being automatically blocked as a potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attempt. To permit valid browser requests to the z/OSMF server, your installation must define the approved web browser origin sites to your installation security white list though your security manager, such as RACF.</li>

						<p>z/OS V2R3 requires that you take the following actions to establish security for cross-site z/OSMF REST requests:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Review your applications and identify those applications that use the z/OSMF REST services.</li>  
							<li>For any applications that make cross-site requests to z/OSMF REST services, update the application by adding the following HTTP custom header to every cross-site request: 
								<dl> 
									<dt>X-CSRF-ZOSMF-HEADER</dt>  
									<dd>This header can be set to any value or an empty string (""). This action is required for both browser and non-browser applications that issue cross-site REST requests to the z/OSMF server on your system.</dd> 
								</dl> 
							</li>  
							<li>To enable REST calls from web browsers, create an exception by adding the browser origin sites to your installation's white list. An exception is required for every approved web browser application that is not running in the same host system and port as the target z/OSMF system. Non-browser applications, such as Java applications, require only the custom header (they do not require a "white list" definition). 
								<p>To create white list exceptions, work with your security administrator to create the appropriate authorizations in your z/OS security product. On a RACF system, for example, this work involves defining generic or discrete profiles for the remote sites in the ZMFAPLA class, and permitting the profiles to the z/OSMF REST interfaces.</p>  
								<p>To define a profile for a remote site, use the following format:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>&lt;SAF_PREFIX&gt;.REST.&lt;identifier&gt;.&lt;reversed-hostname&gt;</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Where:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li> 
										<code>&lt;SAF_PREFIX&gt;</code> is the SAF prefix for your z/OSMF configuration. By default, the prefix is IZUDFLT.
									</li>  
									<li> 
										<code>REST.&lt;identifier&gt;</code> identifies the REST interface that is to be allowed for use by the remote site.
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>For the identifiers for each of the z/OSMF interfaces, see 
							<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izua700/abstract.htm">IBM z/OS Management Facility Programming Guide</a>. To indicate all REST interfaces, specify an asterisk as the identifier.

						</p>  
						<p>IBM previously recommended placing the z/OSMF user directory under /var/zosmf. IBM has changed the recommendation to /global/zosmf for the following reasons:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Make it easier for z/OSMF-based applications with sysplex scope to remain synchronized with sysplex-scoped data repositories, such as the RACF database and TCP/IP profile</li>  
							<li>Make it easier to move the z/OSMF server to different z/OS systems in a sysplex</li>  
							<li>Help simplify automatic recovery from LPAR or z/OSMF server failures.</li>

					<title>z/OSMF: Accommodate the use of IBM z/OS Liberty Embedded</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3, z/OSMF is changed to use IBM WebSphere Liberty Embedded, which is a new base element of z/OS V2R3. In previous releases, z/OSMF used a version of WebSphere Liberty Profile that was supplied with z/OSMF.</p>  
						<p>Related to this change are the following changes to z/OSMF:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>With the installation of APAR PI88651, you can use an alternative name for the z/OSMF angel process (a 
								<dfn>named angel</dfn>) by coding the name on the ANGEL_PROC parameter in the IZUPRMxx member.
							</li>  
							<li>WebSphere Liberty Profile is removed from the z/OSMF file system.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>During initialization, the z/OSMF server attempts to connect to an angel process, which provides authorized services to the z/OSMF server. By default, the z/OSMF angel process is IZUANG1, which is recommended for most z/OS installations. However, you might choose to use a specific 
							<dfn>named angel</dfn> with the z/OSMF server. If so, you must ensure that name of the angel is defined to your system, as described in

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Ensure that you are using the z/OS V2R3 level of the z/OSMF started procedures from your installed PROCLIB data set, as they are different from prior releases. The started procedures are IZUANG1, IZUSVR1, and IZUINSTP. If you customized these procedures in a previous release, you must apply your customizations to the new procedures.</li>  
							<li>If your installation uses an autostarted z/OSMF server, the angel is started internally during system initialization. If you plan to use a named angel (not IZUANG1), you must ensure that name of the angel matches the name of its started procedure. To do so, specify the angel name on the ANGEL_PROC parameter in the IZUPRMxx member. This parameter indicates both the name of the angel and its started procedure.</li>  
							<li>If your installation starts the z/OSMF server through another means, such by operator command or through automation, you must ensure that the specified angel name matches the name of the angel started procedure. You can specify the angel name on the NAME parameter of the START command: START IZUANG1,NAME=proc-name. Or, you can specify the angel name on the NAME parameter of the PROC statement of the IZUANG1 started procedure before you enter the command START IZUANG1.</li>  
							<li>For a named angel, ensure that the following authorizations are done: 
								<ul> 
									<li>z/OSMF user and z/OSMF administrator security groups are authorized to the started procedure name.</li>  
									<li>z/OSMF server started task user ID is authorized to the angel name.</li>

						<p>For ServerPac full system replacement users, the ServerPac installation process creates the required z/OSMF security authorizations in RACF for you. You can use the ServerPac supplied jobs and documentation as a model for another external security product if you desire.</p>  
						<p>Installations that install z/OSMF from a Custom-Built Product Delivery Option (CBPDO) software delivery package, or from a ServerPac order by using the software upgrade method of installation, must perform the steps that are described in this section. The upgrade actions are different, depending on whether your installation currently uses z/OSMF.</p>  
						<strong>For a new z/OSMF installation</strong> : 
						<ul> 
							<li>After you install z/OS V2R3, but before you IPL the system, you must create the SAF authorizations that are described in Appendix A of 
								<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izua300/abstract.htm">IBM z/OS Management Facility Configuration Guide</a>. This action can be done before you install z/OS V2R3, if you add the authorizations to your security database manually, rather than by running the IBM-supplied job in the z/OSMF V2R3 level of SYS1.SAMPLIB (IZUSEC).
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<strong>For an existing z/OSMF installation</strong> : 
						<ul> 
							<li>After you install z/OS V2R3, but before you IPL the system, you must create the SAF authorizations that are described in 
								<a class="xref" href="#izu_CreateSecurityForAlwaysOn__TableSecurityReqsForExisting" title="This table describes the new security setup requirements for existing z/OSMF installations.

						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3, the z/OSMF server is started by default at system IPL. This enhancement, which is referred to as 
							<dfn>z/OSMF autostart</dfn>, means that z/OSMF is available for use as soon as the system is up.
						</p>  
						<p>For existing users of z/OSMF, the z/OSMF autostart capability means that it is no longer necessary for your installation to explicitly start the z/OSMF server after each system IPL, whether through automation or commands entered manually at the operations console. As part of your migration to z/OS V2R3, remove any methods you use to automate the start of the z/OSMF server.

						<p>For an overview of the autostart capability and autostart groups, see

						</p>  
						<p>If one autostart group is sufficient for your sysplex, it is recommended that you allow your systems to use the default autostart group (IZUDFLT). Otherwise, you can define more autostart groups, as needed for your environment. Doing so involves creating one or more IZUPRMxx parmlib members, setting the system parameter IZU=, and customizing the IZUSVR1 started procedure.</p>  
						<p>For ServerPac installers, if you select the ServerPac full system replacement installation type, z/OSMF is configured through a ServerPac post-installation job, using IBM defaults. The default configuration includes the parmlib and proclib member setup that is described in the steps that follow. Therefore, if you use the parmlib and proclib members from ServerPac, you do not need to perform the following steps. However, you might want to review the ServerPac provided members to ensure that they contain suitable values for your installation, or modify them, as you require.</p>  
						<p>To perform the parmlib updates, follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Create an IZUPRMxx parmlib member with the following statements specified as required for your environment: 
								<dl> 
									<dt>AUTOSTART( 
										<u>LOCAL</u>CONNECT)
									</dt>  
									<dd>Specifies the capability for autostarting the z/OSMF server on this system. 
										<ul> 
											<li>AUTOSTART(LOCAL) indicates that the system can autostart a z/OSMF server.</li>  
											<li>AUTOSTART(CONNECT) indicates that the system cannot autostart a z/OSMF server. Instead, the system uses the z/OSMF server on another system in the same autostart group.</li> 
										</ul>  
										<p>For a monoplex, specify AUTOSTART(LOCAL).</p>  
										<p>By default, AUTOSTART is set to LOCAL.</p> 
									</dd>  
									<dt>AUTOSTART_GROUP( 
										<u>IZUDFLT</u>'nnnnnnnn')
									</dt>  
									<dd>Assigns a name to the autostart group. z/OSMF includes one autostart group name by default (called IZUDFLT). To associate a group of systems with a different autostart group, ensure that the IZUPRMxx member for each system specifies the same value for AUTOSTART_GROUP. 
										<p>The name can consist of 1-32 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) or special characters (#, $, or @). Alphabetic characters are case insensitive.</p>  
										<p>By default, AUTOSTART_GROUP is set to IZUDFLT.</p> 
									</dd>  
									<dt>SERVER_PROC(proc-name)</dt>  
									<dd>Specifies the started procedure that is used to start the z/OSMF server on this system. It is recommended that you use the default started procedure, IZUSVR1, which should be adequate for most z/OS installations. If you specify an alternative procedure name, such as IZUSVR2, ensure that the z/OSMF user and z/OSMF administrator security groups are authorized to the started procedure name. 
										<p>The name can consist of 1 to eight alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) or special characters (#, $, or @). This value is not case-sensitive; lowercase alphabetic characters are folded to uppercase.</p>  
										<p>By default, SERVER_PROC is set to IZUSVR1.</p> 
									</dd>  
									<dt>ANGEL_PROC(proc-name)</dt>  
									<dd>Specifies the started procedure that is used internally to start the z/OSMF angel process on this system. It is recommended that you use the default procedure, IZUANG1, which should be adequate for most z/OS installations. If you specify an alternative procedure name, ensure that the z/OSMF user and z/OSMF administrator security groups are authorized to the started procedure name. 
										<p>The name can consist of 1 to eight alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) or special characters (#, $, or @). This value is not case-sensitive; lowercase alphabetic characters are folded to uppercase.</p>  
										<p>By default, ANGEL_PROC is set to IZUANG1.</p> 
									</dd> 
								</dl> 
							</li>  
							<li>Ensure that the 
								<code>IZU=</code> specification is coded to include the suffixes of the appropriate IZUPRMxx members for each system in your sysplex. You can specify up to 38 member suffixes on the IZU= parameter in your IEASYSxx member.
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>To perform the proclib updates, follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Ensure that you are using the z/OS V2R4 level of the z/OSMF started procedures from your installed PROCLIB data set, as they are different from prior releases. The started procedures are IZUANG1, IZUSVR1, and IZUINSTP. 
								<p>The IZUINSTP procedure was added in z/OS V2R3; it is used by the z/OSMF server for communicating with z/OS components. Install IZUINSTP, but do not modify it.</p>  
								<p>Place the started procedures (IZUANG1, IZUSVR1, and IZUINSTP) in a data set that is in the IEFPDSI concatenation that is used by the system to find started procedures before the primary subsystem (JES) initializes. It is recommended that this data set is the same data set that is used by JES to find started procedures after JES initializes.</p>  
								<p>For existing z/OSMF installations, if you have older levels of the started procedures IZUANG1 and IZUSVR1, you must remove them. Otherwise, the z/OSMF server might not start on a z/OS V2R4 system.</p> Note: 
								<p>Another started procedure, IZUSVR2, is provided in SYS1.SAMPLIB. If you choose not to autostart the z/OSMF server, the IZUSVR2 procedure can be used for starting the z/OSMF server manually.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Modify the started procedure for the z/OSMF server, IZUSVR1, to control its start-up behavior, as follows: 
								<ul> 
									<li>On the parameter SERVER, specify either 
										<code>AUTOSTART</code> or 
										<code>STANDALONE</code>, as follows: 
										<ul> 
											<li>Specify 
												<code>AUTOSTART</code> to have the server started automatically.
											</li>  
											<li>Specify 
												<code>STANDALONE</code> if you want to start the server manually by using the START command.
											</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>If you specify 
										<code>SERVER=AUTOSTART</code>, you can specify one of the following values on the parameter IZUPRM: 
										<dl> 
											<dt>PREV</dt>  
											<dd>Use the IZUPRMxx suffixes, if any were used by the previous instance of z/OSMF within the current IPL. IZUPRM='PREV' is used as the default in the standard IZUSVR1 procedure. IZUPRM='PREV' behaves like IZUPRM='SYSPARM' when the system encounters it during the initial IPL time (the first use of the IZUSVR1 procedure) because there is no previous instance of z/OSMF to use. 
												<p>This setting is not valid if the SERVER parameter is set to 
													<code>STANDALONE</code>.
												</p> 
											</dd>  
											<dt>SYSPARM</dt>  
											<dd>Use the IZUPRMxx suffixes that are specified on the IZU system parameter in IEASYSxx. 
												<p>This setting is not valid if the SERVER parameter is set to 
													<code>STANDALONE</code>.
												</p> 
											</dd>  
											<dt>NONE</dt>  
											<dd>To indicate that no IZUPRMxx members are read at server start-up.</dd>  
											<dt>xx(xx,...,zz)</dt>  
											<dd>Specify the specific suffixes for the IZUPRMxx parmlib member or members that you want the procedure to use. If you specify a suffix, the member must exist in your parmlib concatenation. Otherwise, the procedure cannot be started. Multiple suffixes must be enclosed in parentheses. 
												<p>The following syntax forms are valid:</p>  
												<ul> 
													<li> 
														<code>IZUPRM=(xx,yy,...)</code> 
													</li>  
													<li> 
														<code>IZUPRM=xx</code> 
													</li>  
													<li> 
														<code>IZUPRM=NONE</code> 
													</li> 
												</ul>  
												<p>This setting is not valid if the SERVER parameter is set to 
													<code>STANDALONE</code>.
												</p> Note: 
												<p>The IZUPRMxx suffixes you specify, explicitly or implicitly, in the IZUPRM parameter of the procedure override any suffixes that are defined in the IZU system parameter in IEASYSxx.</p> 
											</dd> 
										</dl> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ol>  
						<strong>If you prefer not to have z/OSMF started automatically during IPL</strong>  
						<p>: You can disable the autostart function for one or more z/OS systems, as follows:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>To prevent a z/OS system from autostarting the z/OSMF server, ensure that the system uses a IZUPRMxx member that specifies 
								<code>AUTOSTART(CONNECT)</code>. This setting causes the system to connect to the autostart group that is specified on the AUTOSTART_GROUP statement, rather than autostarting its own server.
							</li>  
							<li>To prevent a z/OS system from connecting to an autostart group, specify the name of a group on the AUTOSTART_GROUP parameter that is not used by any autostart server in the sysplex. For example, 
								<code>AUTOSTART_GROUP('NEVERUSED')</code>.
							</li>  
							<li>Similarly, for each system for which you want to disable z/OSMF autostart, ensure that the 
								<code>AUTOSTART(CONNECT)</code> and 
								<code>AUTOSTART_GROUP('NEVERUSED')</code> settings are in effect.
							</li>  
							<li>In your 
								<code>IZU=</code> specifications, verify that the IZU= parameter identifies the suffixes of the IZUPRMxx members that contain the desired settings.
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>If you disable autostart on a z/OS system, be aware that the JES2 Email Delivery Services (EDS) function in z/OS does not operate on that system with full function until you enable the z/OSMF autostart function, or allow the system to connect to a valid autostart group. Otherwise, JES2 cannot send e-mail notifications to users who submit jobs. For information about configuring JES2 EDS, see the topic

						</p> Note: 
						<p>Changing an AUTOSTART_GROUP name requires an IPL. You cannot change this option with a stop and restart of the z/OSMF server.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In z/OSMF, a 
							<dfn>service</dfn> is a collection of one or more system management tasks and REST APIs that add function to z/OSMF. When you configure a service, you make its tasks available to z/OSMF users.
						</p> Terminology Note: 
						<p>In previous releases of z/OSMF, the z/OSMF services were referred to as 
							<dfn>z/OSMF plug-ins</dfn>.
						</p>  
						<p>Depending on your operational goal, z/OSMF can be configured with various combinations of core and optional services. If your installation does not already use any of the z/OSMF optional services, it is recommended (not required) that you enable one or more of the following services:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Capacity Provisioning</li>  
							<li>Incident Log</li>  
							<li>ISPF</li>  
							<li>Network Configuration Assistant for z/OS Communications Server</li>  
							<li>Resource Monitoring</li>  
							<li>Software Management</li>  
							<li>Sysplex Management</li>  
							<li>Workload Management.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>By default, z/OSMF does not include any of the z/OSMF optional services.</p>

						<p>If your installation does not already use the z/OSMF optional services, choose one or more of the services to enable. Your decision on which services to enable depends in part on your installation's readiness to perform the various z/OS system customizations that are associated with each service.

						<p>In Infoprint Server for z/OS V2R4, dynamic configuration is always enabled.</p>  
						<p>Advantages of dynamic configuration include the following:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Authorized administrators can use the Infoprint Server ISPF panels or the Printer Inventory Definition Utility (PIDU) to view and change the dynamic attributes rather than editing the file /etc./Printsrv/aopd.conf</li>  
							<li>If you change an attribute in the system configuration definition, with a few exceptions, you do not need to stop and restart Infoprint Server for the change to take effect.</li>  
							<li>You can configure Infoprint Server to start and stop individual daemons.</li>  
							<li>You can benefit from new functions in Infoprint Server that require dynamic configuration. For example, you can use the MVS system logger function.</li>

					<title>z/OS Network Authentication Service (Kerberos) requires ICSF</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Before z/OS V2R3, the Network Authentication Service (Kerberos) did not require ICSF to perform encryption, decryption, and hashing. The product had both its own software implementation of the encrypt/decrypt/hashing functions and a hardware implementation through calls to ICSF CCA callable services. Starting with z/OS V2R3, Kerberos is removing the software implementation of encrypt/decrypt and some of the hashing functions and replacing with calls to ICSF PKCS#11 callable services. Kerberos calls ICSF CCA callable services to encrypt/decrypt/hash when not running in FIPS mode, and calls ICSF PKCS#11 callable services for encrypt/decrypt/hashing when running in FIPS mode.</p>  
						<p>This change allows Network Authentication Service to run with FIPS evaluated cryptographic functions and remove the need to maintain multiple implementations of the cryptographic functions on the platform. As a result of this change, ICSF is required to be running before any Kerberos components or applications are run on the z/OS system. Also, the default encryption and checksum (hash) types used when not explicitly set in the Kerberos configuration files are changed from weak and non-collision proof types to stronger, more secure types.</p>

							<li>Ensure that ICSF is started and completes initialization before starting the z/OS KDC or any application that is enabled for Kerberos on the system. ICSF needs to be running during use of all Kerberos functions. (KDC, application servers, application clients, commands, and utilities).</li>  
							<li>If the CSFSERV class is active, ensure the z/OS KDC user ID and all user IDs that use Kerberos commands or applications that are enabled for Kerberos that are running on z/OS systems have READ access to the following ICSF resources: 
								<ul> 
									<li>When FIPS is enabled: 
										<pre> 
<code>CSFRNG, CSFOWH, CSF1TRC, CSF1TRD, CSF1SKD and CSF1SKE</code>
										</pre> 
									</li>  
									<li>When FIPS is not enabled: 
										<pre> 
<code>CSFRNG and CSFOWH</code>
										</pre> 
									</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>The default KDC ticket encryption types are changed from weak DES encryption types to more secure encryption types (AES and DES3). If the former default encryption types are to continue to be used, they must be explicitly set in the z/OS KDC environment variable file (/etc/skrb/home/kdc/envar by default) by specifying: 
								<pre> 
<code>SKDC_TKT_ENCTYPES=des-cbc-crc</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>The runtime environment variable _EUV_HW_CRYPTO no longer has any meaning since ICSF PKCS#11 services now make the determination whether cryptographic hardware is available and is used. Therefore, its use is deprecated.</li>  
							<li>The default encryption types for Kerberos commands and applications are changed from weak DES encryption types to more secure encryption types (AES and DES3). If the former default encryption types are to continue to be used, they must be set explicitly in the Kerberos configuration files (/etc/skrb/krb5.conf by default) by specifying:

					<title>z/OS RACF Kerberos password settings and changing requires ICSF</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>The RACF database can be used by the Network Authentication Service as the database for Kerberos user principals, the Ticket Granting Service (TGS), and foreign realm definitions. When the RACF database is used by Network Authentication Service, RACF commands are used to administer Kerberos principals. Kerberos principals and the TGS must maintain a set of encryption keys that are based on or derived from a password. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt information that is sent over a network to ensure the security and privacy of the information.</p>  
						<p>When a user who has been defined to contain Kerberos information changes their password, a Network Authentication Service API is called from the RACF password change logic to generate a new set of encryption keys that are based on or derived from the new password. The local and foreign Kerberos realm definitions are similar to user profiles because they also maintain a set of encryption keys that are based on or derived from a password that is associated with the REALM class profile.</p>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R3, the Network Authentication Service component is updated to use the ICSF CSFBOWH function in the key generation process. Due to this requirement:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>ICSF must be started and initialization complete prior to changing the password of a user that has a KERB segment or changing a password for a REALM class profile.</li>  
							<li>If the CSFSERV class is active and a protection profile exists for the CSFOWH resource (which protects the CSFBOWH function), READ access is required to this resource. An alternative to permitting access to the CSFOWH resource, the authorization checks for the CSFOWH resource can be disabled by defining the CSF.CSFSERV.AUTH.CSFOWH.DISABLE resource profile in the XFACILIT class.</li>

						<p>Determine whether any of your users or programs use the ISPF Workstation Agent (WSA), also known as the ISPF client/server component. If so, IBM recommends the use of more current file transfer solutions, such as those provided by z/OS FTP, the sftp utility of OpenSSH, or another file transfer mechanism. These solutions have more capabilities, including the ability to provide secure communications.</p>  
						<p>If you must use ISPF Workstation Agent on a z/OS V2R4 system, take the following actions to secure it:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Use the following commands to define the resource 
								<code>ISPF.WSA</code> in the FACILITY class with a universal access (UACC) of READ. Doing so allows users to initiate a connection to the ISPF Workstation Agent. 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE FACILITY ISPF.WSA UACC(READ) SETROPTS RACLIST(FACILITY) REFRESH</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>Use the following commands to define the resource 
								<code>ISPF.WSA</code> in the FACILITY class with a universal access (UACC) of NONE and to permit individual users READ access to the resource. Doing so allows individual users to initiate a connection to the ISPF Workstation Agent. 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE FACILITY ISPF.WSA UACC(NONE) PERMIT ISPF.WSA CLASS(FACILITY) ID(user_id) ACCESS(READ) SETROPTS RACLIST(FACILITY) REFRESH</code>

									<li>If you enter the $ACTIVATE,LEVEL=z22 command, activation of CYL_MANAGED support is required.</li>  
									<li>You might see that z22 mode requires an extra nnn 4K records for CKPT1.</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li>Enter the JES2 $ACTIVATE command to verify non-configuration changes that must be accommodated before you go to z22, and to activate z22 mode. See the considerations for this command in 
								<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.hasa200/abstract.htm">

						<p>By default, JES2 restarts in the same mode as the other members of the MAS (if any are active) or the mode of the last active JES2 member when it was shut down. To restart JES2 in z11 mode during a COLD start, specify 
							<code>UNACT</code> on PARM=. On a cold start, JES2 starts in z22 mode, unless overridden by the OPTSDEF COLD_START_MODE or UNACT parameter.

						<p>Applications and exits that do not run in the JES2 address space can access checkpoint version data from the IAZDSERV data area, which provides a stable copy of the data. To access the IAZDSERV data area, applications can use subsystem interface call (SSI) 71, subfunction SSJIFOBT, and JES2 exits can use the $DSERV macro.</p>  
						<p>Before z/OS V2R4, the data returned by these services was in a 31-bit storage data space. Starting in z/OS V2R4, the returned data might reside in 64-bit storage.</p>  
						<p>z/OS V2R4 adds version 10 of the IAZDSERV data area, which supports 64-bit pointers and ALETs for use in accessing the checkpoint version data. Version 10 is the only IAZDSERV version that is supported by z/OS V2R4.</p>

						<p>Check for applications and exits that access checkpoint version data from the IAZDSERV data area. Determine whether this code must access the checkpoint data blocks directly.</p>  
						<p>As an alternative to using the IAZDSERV data area directly, your code can use an SSI call to access checkpoint version data. IBM recommends that you evaluate the use of SSI calls, such as SSI 80 (extended status) or SSI 82 (JES property SSI). Determine whether you can use these services to obtain the data that you require. Otherwise, you must upgrade your code to accept the 64-bit data pointers that are returned in the version 10 IAZDSERV data area.</p>  
						<p>If you use the $DSERV macro in an exit, be aware that the IAZDSERV data area it returns is at the version 10 level and therefore contains 64-bit pointers. All JES2 services that use the $DSERV macro as input are upgraded in z/OS V2R4 to accept the version 10 of the IAZDSERV data area.</p>  
						<p>In general, unless your code must reference individual fields in the $DSERV mapping, it should not require changes. However, it your code references fields in the $DSERV, you must upgrade your code to use the 64-bit fields and run in 64-bit addressing mode.</p>

					<title>JES2: Accommodate changes in NJE input phase processing for multi-object job streams</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Before z/OS V2R4, if an NJE job stream contained more that one job or job group, the stream and all jobs within it would fail input phase processing. Starting with z/OS V2R4, JES2 now supports multiple job and job group objects in an NJE job transmission stream. This is done by keeping all the jobs in the stream busy in the INPUT phase of processing until the job trailer (end of the job stream) is received. When received, the jobs complete input phase processing and are queued to the next phase. If an error occurs on the connection and the job trailer is not received, all of the jobs are purged from the receiving system. When the NJE connection is reestablished, the entire job stream is sent again.</p>  
						<p>This change implies a number of subtle changes in how input phase processing works:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Multiple jobs and job groups can be marked busy on a job receiver at the same time</li>  
							<li>Final processing for the jobs is delayed until the job trailer is received. This includes exits 20 and 50 (end of input exits) and exit 51 (queue change). As a result, the end of input exit for the first job in the stream is not given control until all other input exits (job statement, accounting string, JCL statement) are called for all of the jobs. The environment in which the end of input exit is called is the same as in prior releases, however, the order is changed.</li>  
							<li>When a connection drops, because multiple jobs can exist on the NJE job receiver, all of these jobs must be purged. Prior releases would only have at most one job that needed to be purged.</li>

For example, if you have any exits or procedures that rely on only one job or job group being active on a particular NJE job receiver at a time, review and update those exits and procedures. Similarly, if you have an end of input exit or a queue change exit that relies on being called immediately after other input exits for a particular job, review those exits and change them appropriately.</p>

					<title>JES3: Plan for migration to JES2 in a future release</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>The release that follows z/OS V2R4 is planned to be the last release of z/OS that will include JES3 as a feature. If you are one of the clients who remains on JES3, IBM encourages you to start planning your migration.</p>  
						<p>In IBM United States Software Announcement 217-246 
							<cite>IBM z/OS Version 2 Release 3 - Engine for digital transformation</cite>, dated July 17, 2017, IBM announced that JES2 is the strategic Job Entry Subsystem (JES) for the z/OS Operating System and that JES3 would continue to be supported and maintained.
						</p>  
						<p>To date, IBM has made significant investment in JES2 by delivering unique functions, such as email support in JCL, spool migration and merge, and dynamic checkpoint expansion and tuning to make management easier. In z/OS V2R4, IBM adds JES2 Spool Encryption and a new user exit alternative, based on defining policies that allow exit programs to be implemented in a parameterized rule-based approach.</p>  
						<p>To help JES3 to JES2 migration efforts, JES2 adds functions, including dependent job control, deadline scheduling, 8-character job classes, and interpreting JES3 JECL control statements. For z/OS V2R4, more function to aid in migrations is added, including Disk Reader capability and enhanced JES3 JECL support in JES2 (ROUTE XEQ).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R3 JES3, the fixed area of the Job Data Accounting Block – JDAB (IATYJDA) is extended to accommodate more fields. As the JDAB is maintained on JES3 spool, a version field JDABVER is added to identify when fields in the extended area are available. Equate JDABVER0 is defined for JDABs created by a JES3 global previous to V2R3. Equate JDABVER1 is defined for JDABs created by a JES3 global at V2R3 and later.</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>JDABVER DS X Version ID JDABVER0 EQU 0 Version 0 (pre-V2R3) JDABVER1 EQU 1 Version 1 (Starting with V2R3) JDABCVER EQU JDABVER1 Current version</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>An eight-character field JDABNTF8 is added to accommodate user IDs from the NOTIFY= parameter of the JOB JCL statement with up to 8 characters. Existing seven-character field JDABNTFY is used for JDABs created by a JES3 global previous to V2R3 (JDABVER0). New field, JDABNTF8, is used for JDABs created by a JES3 global at V2R3 and later (JDABVER1). JDABNTFY continues to be set when the NOTIFY= user ID is 7 characters or less. Otherwise, it is set to blanks.</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>JDABNTF8 DS CL8 NOTIFY= 8-character user id</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>Extending the fixed area might impact customer modifications and user exits that access existing field JDABNTFY (seven-character user ID) or access the JDAB scheduler elements, JDABNTRY DSECT, which follows the fixed area. Examples of user exits that might access the JDAB are IATUX14, IATUX27, IATUX29, and IATUX36.</p>

							<li>Ensure that users who must be able to obtain Language Environment resources are permitted to the IEAABD.DMPAKEY resource.</li>  
							<li>For JSCBPASS Language Environment applications, look for authorized programs that:

									<li>Have a PPT statement that specifies NOPASS, or</li>  
									<li>Explicitly set JSCBPASS when the programs are not running as started tasks.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>As an alternative, these applications can use recovery routines to produce an SVC dump or IEATDUMP for diagnostic purposes. If a dump is needed, and one is not produced, a SLIP trap can be set to get an SVC dump.</p>

The CSD samples from the latest release of z/OS can be used for earlier releases of z/OS that can co-exist with the current release.</p>  
						<p>If your installation is running CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 4.2 or earlier, you must update the CSD file with the program definitions in member CEECCSD and member CEECCSDX. For later releases of CICS TS, you can skip this step if your installation uses the automatic update function that was provided in APARs PI60389 and PI73184.</p>

								<em>AFHWMLP2</em> : This is a sample of all Language Environment Fortran component modules eligible for the LPA.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>CEEWLPA</em> : This is a sample of a PROGxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB that includes all Language Environment CEE-prefixed runtime modules eligible for the LPA (that is, all Language Environment base modules) except the callable services stubs.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>CELQWLPA</em> : This is a sample for AMODE 64 runtime support.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>EDCWLPA</em> : This is a sample of a PROGxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB that includes all Language Environment EDC-prefixed and CEH-prefixed runtime modules eligible for the LPA (that is, all z/OS XL C/C++ component modules) except locales and code page converters.
							</li>  
							<li> 
								<em>IBMALLP2 (or IBMPLPA1 for Enterprise PL/I for z/OS)</em> : This is a sample of all Language Environment PL/I component modules eligible for the LPA.

						</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>If the RMODE is ANY, the module can reside in the LPA or in the ELPA (above or below the 16 MB line).</li>  
							<li>If the RMODE is 24, the module can reside only in the LPA (below the 16 MB line).</li>

SCEELPA contains Language Environment load modules that are reentrant, that reside above the 16 MB line, and that are heavily used by z/OS.

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS V2R4 removes support for the OSA Support Facility (OSA/SF) element. IBM recommends that you stop using this element.</p>  
						<p>No change to the OSA cards' strategic importance to z/OS is meant by this change. z/OS continues to support the networking operational use of OSA adapters.</p>  
						<p>OSA Support Facility (OSA/SF) is used to configure devices on Open Systems Adapter (OSA) cards that are used for the SNA protocol and to support and manage all OSA features. OSA/SF in z/OS has both a graphical user interface and a REXX API. On EC12/BC12 systems, IBM introduced support to configure these devices on the latest generation OSA adapters (OSA Express5S) and to support and manage these adapters exclusively using the Hardware Management Console (HMC), with no capability to configure or manage devices on these adapters provided in the z/OS OSA/SF application. The OSA/SF on the HMC functionality can be used to configure and manage OSA-Express4S and newer generation adapters.</p>

						<p>To allow insecure communication for the DDS, you can specify the option HTTPS(NO) in the GPMSRVxx parmlib member. However, this setting is not recommended because it allows the DDS to accept insecure connections.</p>  
						<p>Before you can configure the DDS, you must enable the Policy Agent for AT-TLS. Information about how to set up AT-TLS communication is provided in 
							<cite>z/OS Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide</cite> and 
							<cite>z/OS Security Server RACF Security Administrator's Guide</cite>. For other security management products, refer to the corresponding security product documentation.
						</p>  
						<p>The following example shows a rule that enables secure communication with the DDS:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code># RMF Distributed Data Server Rule TTLSRule DDSServerRule { LocalPortRange 8803 Jobname GPMSERVE Direction Inbound Priority 1 TTLSGroupActionRef DDSServerGRP TTLSEnvironmentActionRef DDSServerENV } TTLSGroupAction DDSServerGRP { TTLSEnabled On Trace 1 } TTLSEnvironmentAction DDSServerENV { HandshakeRole Server TTLSKeyringParms { Keyring DDSServerKeyring } TTLSEnvironmentAdvancedParms { ServerCertificateLabel RMFDDS } }</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>The example rule is described, as follows:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>TTLSRule: Jobname</dt>  
							<dd>The name value specifies the job name of the application. GPMSERVE is the job name of the DDS</dd>  
							<dt>TTLSRule: LocalPortRange</dt>  
							<dd>The local port the application is bound to for this rule's action to be performed. 8803 is the default HTTP Port of the DDS.</dd>  
							<dt>TTLSRule: Direction</dt>  
							<dd>Specifies the direction from which the connection must be initiated for this rule's action to be performed. In this example, Inbound is specified, which means that the rule applies to connection requests that arrive inbound to the local host.</dd>  
							<dt>TTLSRule: Priority</dt>  
							<dd>An integer value in the range 1 -2000000000 represents the priority that is associated with the rule. The highest priority value is 2000000000. If you use multiple rules for the DDS server, the more specific a rule is, the higher its priority should be. Generic rules without detail specifications of the incoming connections should have a low priority.</dd>  
							<dt>TTLSEnvironmentAction: HandshakeRole</dt>  
							<dd>Specifies the SSL handshake role to be taken for connections in this AT-TLS environment. In this example, Server is specified which means that the SSL hand shake is performed as a server.</dd>  
							<dt>TTLSKeyringParms: Keyring</dt>  
							<dd>Specifies the path and file name of the key database z/OS® UNIX file, the ring name of the SAF key ring, or the name of the z/OS PKCS #11 token. In this example, the RACF key ring DDSServerKeyring is specified.</dd>  
							<dt>TTLSEnvironmentAdvancedParms: ServerCertificateLabel</dt>  
							<dd>Specifies the label of the certificate for a server application to authenticate the server. In this example, the DDS Server certificate with the label RMFDDS is used.</dd>

					<title>SDSF: Verify that the SDSF address spaces are started at IPL</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Starting with z/OS V2R3, SDSF requires the SDSF and SDSFAUX address spaces to be active for full functionality. The SDSF address space manages connections, processes ISFPRMxx statements, handles operator commands, and starts and stops SDSFAUX. The SDSFAUX address space is used for data gathering requests.</p>  
						<p>Usually, the SDSF address space is started during IPL using COMMNDxx. During SDSF initialization, the SDSFAUX address space is started.</p>  
						<p>When a user accesses SDSF, the SDSF client program attempts to connect to the SDSF address space (also referred to as the SDSF server). To connect to the SDSF server, the user must have READ access to the 
							<code>ISF.CONNECT.system</code> resource in the SDSF class.
						</p>  
						<p>If the SDSF address space is not active, SDSF provides limited functionality. The user must have READ access to the 
							<code>SERVER.NOPARM</code> resource in the SDSF class so that ISFPARMS can be used instead of ISFPRMxx. Panels that require the use of the SDSFAUX data gatherers (such as APF, LPA, and LNK) are not available.
						</p>  
						<p>If the SDSF address is active, but no ISFPRMxx is in effect (such as a syntax error during startup), SDSFAUX is not started. The user requires access to the 
							<code>SERVER.NOPARM</code> resource to fall back to ISFPARMS and requires READ access to the 
							<code>ISF.CONNECT.system</code> resource to continue. Panels that require the use of SDSFAUX are not available.
						</p>  
						<p>If the SDSF address space is active, but the SDSF class is not active or not RACLISTed, the SDSF server allows requests based on the ISFPRMxx CONNECT definition. When AUXSAF(FAILRC4) is in effect (the default), the request is denied. The user cannot connect to the SDSF server and the SDSFAUX related panels are not available. SDSF falls back to ISFPARMS because access to the 
							<code>SERVER.NOPARM</code> resource results in a return code 04 (indeterminate result).
						</p>  
						<p>When AUXSAF(NOFAILRC4) is in effect, the server allows the request, but access to the panel is controlled through the definitions in ISFPARMS.</p>  
						<p>IBM recommends that you start the SDSF server. Although V2R4 provides limited functionality when the server is not active, this might not be the case in subsequent releases.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>ISFPARMS in SDSF is used for specifying global options, the format of panels, and security for SDSF functions. SDSF provides two alternatives for ISFPARMS:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Assembler macros that you define, assemble, and then link into the SDSF load library. This is the original format for defining ISFPARMS and it continues to be supported for compatibility.</li>  
							<li>Dynamic statements, which are in parmlib member ISFPRMxx. Dynamic statements are the recommended format. They are easier to code and are more dynamic than the assembler macros; they can be updated without reassembling or link-editing. The statements are processed by an SDSF server, which is controlled by MVS operator commands.</li>

										<p>To verify that SDSF dynamic statements in ISFPRMxx are being used rather than the assembler macros, use check IBMSDSF,SDSF_ISFPARMS_IN_USE.

										<p>SDSF registers this check with the IBM Health Checker for z/OS infrastructure when the SDSF server address space is initialized. However, one of the items this check verifies is that the SDSF server itself is in use, so you have to manually add this check (particularly if you do not use the SDSF server) so that the IBM Health Checker for z/OS infrastructure invokes the check. To add the check, put the following statement in your PROGxx parmlib member: 
											<code>EXIT ADD EXITNAME(HZSADDCHECK) MODNAME(ISFHCADC)</code>.
										</p>  
										<p>SDSF health checks are distributed in ISF.SISFLOAD for installations running SDSF in the LNKLST. The checks are also distributed in ISF.SISFLINK for installations that do not run SDSF in the LNKLST. For those installations, ISF.SISFLINK must be added to the LNKLST.</p> Note: 
										<p>To avoid a possible ABEND 290 with reason code 02014007 issued by HZSADDCK:</p>  
										<ul> 
											<li>Specify the proper check routine name. The check routine module must be in an APF-authorized library. The system must be able to locate the check routine within the joblib, the steplib of the IBM Health Checker for z/OS address space, the LPA, or the LNKLST.</li>  
											<li>Specify the proper message table name. The message table module must be in an APF-authorized library. The system must be able to locate the message table within the joblib, the steplib of the IBM Health Checker for z/OS address space, the LPA, or the LNKLST.</li>

						<p>If you are already using dynamic statements for ISFPARMS, there is no upgrade action to perform.</p>  
						<p>If you are using assembler macros for ISFPARMS, do one of the following:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Convert your existing ISFPARMS to dynamic statements by using a conversion utility that you invoke with the ISFACP command.</li>  
							<li>Reassemble your customized ISFPARMS for use with z/OS V2R4. Reassembly must be done whenever you change your z/OS release. Before reassembling ISFPARMS, you might want to update it for new function. The assembler ISFPARMS cannot be shared with any other release of SDSF. Only use ISFPARMS for the release on which it is assembled. Note: 
								<p>If you have an SMP/E usermod that specifies modifications to assembler macro ISFPARMS, change the usermod to indicate that module ISFPARMS is now owned by the z/OS base V2R4 SDSF FMID (HQX77C0). The correct SMP/E syntax is 
									<code>++VER(Z038) FMID(HQX77C0)</code>.
								</p>  
								<p>Also, in the SMP/E usermod, change the distlib to reference DISTLIB(AISFSRC). The correct SMP/E syntax is

						<p>As of z/OS V2R3, the main panel of SDSF is restructured to use a scrollable table. This change allows new commands to be added, regardless of the screen depth. Entries in the table can be located, sorted, and filtered to help with selecting commands.</p>  
						<p>As part of this change, the title line of the main panel is changed. In previous releases, the main panel title contained the string “SDSF PRIMARY OPTION MENU.” In z/OS V2R3, the title line contains the string “SDSF MENU” in the upper left corner.</p>  
						<p>A compatibility mode is provided, which causes SDSF to use the older format. This mode can be enabled, either by using a custom property or a special DDNAME allocated to the user’s session.</p>  
						<p>A new SDSF custom property 
							<code>Panel.Main.DisableTable</code> is implemented. When set to 
							<code>false</code> (the default), the SDSF main panel is rendered as a table.
						</p>  
						<p>When the special ddname ISFMIGMN is allocated (typically to a dummy data set) or the 
							<code>Panel.Main.DisableTable</code> custom property is set to 
							<code>true</code>, the panel is rendered in the older style two-column layout. However, only the options that fit within the older screen depth are shown.
						</p> Note: 
						<p>All SDSF options are available, even if not visible due to insufficient screen depth.</p>  
						<p>If your installation has programs that post-process SDSF screen output and the programs rely on the SDSF main menu title 
							<code>“ SDSF PRIMARY OPTION MENU”</code>, you must modify your programs to check for the new SDSF main menu title line.

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>This action is required only if you are using the Operational Decision Manager (ODM) and have defined the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, or HBRCMD classes in the RACF dynamic class descriptor table. You can determine whether the class is defined in the dynamic CDT by looking for HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, or HBRCMD in the output of the following command:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>SEARCH CLASS(CDT)</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>This action changes the current POSIT number of the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes to match the value of the IBM class of the same name, which is added when the system is next IPLed.</p>  
						<p>Between steps 4 and 5 of the procedure that follows, the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes are not active on the systems that share the RACF database.</p>  
						<p>This procedure should be performed at a time of low ODM activity on all systems that share the RACF database. Alternatively, the ODM server, and all applications that use it, can be stopped on all systems that share the RACF database until step 5 is performed.</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Enter the following command to list the SETROPTS options for all classes. 
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS LIST</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Record all active system options for the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Record the current POSIT value of the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes, which can be displayed by using the following command. 
								<pre> 
<code>RLIST CDT HBRADMIN CDTINFO NORACF RLIST CDT HBRCONN CDTINFO NORACF RLIST CDT HBRCMD CDTINFO NORACF</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>Change the POSIT value. 
								<pre> 
<code>RALTER CDT HBRADMIN CDTINFO(POSIT(603)) RALTER CDT HBRCONN CDTINFO(POSIT(603)) RALTER CDT HBRCMD CDTINFO(POSIT(603))</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Ignore the IRR52190I message that is issued by RALTER.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Refresh the CDT class on all systems that share the RACF database and which use the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD class. 
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS RACLIST(CDT) REFRESH</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Ignore the following ICH14079I message that is issued by SETROPTS:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>ICH14079I RACF detected an error in the dynamic class descriptor table entry HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, or HBRCMD, error code 08.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>This message is also issued during IPL on any earlier system until step 10 is performed. These IPL messages can also be ignored.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Activate the desired SETROPTS options by using the SETROPTS LIST output from step 1 as reference. This example assumes that the SETROPTS options CLASSACT, RACLIST, GENERIC, and GENCMD were previously active for the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes. 
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS CLASSACT(HBRADMIN) RACLIST(HBRADMIN) GENERIC(HBRADMIN)</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>Examine all dynamic and static CDT entries to see whether any other existing classes share the previous POSIT value of the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes. If another existing class shares the current POSIT value, continue at step 10. 
								<p>If no other existing classes share the previous POSIT value, continue with step 7 to ensure that any new class does not have unexpected options if you add a class with that POSIT value in the future.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Add a new, unique, temporary dynamic class and assign it the previous POSIT value of the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes. For example, if the class name $TEMPCLS is not in use, and the previous POSIT value of the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes was 200, enter the following command. 
								<pre> 
<code>RDEFINE CDT $TEMPCLS CDTINFO(POSIT(200))</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Followed by the command:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS RACLIST(CDT) REFRESH</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>Deactivate the SETROPTS settings that you recorded in Step 1. For example, if the SETROPTS options CLASSACT, RACLIST, GENERIC, and GENCMD were active for the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes, you would enter the following command to deactivate those options. 
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS NOCLASSACT($TEMPCLS) NORACLIST($TEMPCLS) NOGENERIC($TEMPCLS) NOGENCMD($TEMPCLS)</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>Delete the temporary class. 
								<pre> 
<code>RDELETE CDT $TEMPCLS</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>Followed by the command:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS RACLIST(CDT) REFRESH</code>
								</pre> 
							</li>  
							<li>After all of the systems that share the RACF database are IPLed with z/OS V2R4 and you have no plans to fall back to a prior z/OS release, you can delete the installation-defined dynamic version of the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes. Delete the CDT class profile that defines the HBRADMIN, HBRCONN, and HBRCMD classes by using the following command: 
								<pre> 
<code>RDELETE CDT HBRADMIN RDELETE CDT HBRCONN RDELETE CDT HBRCMD</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>followed by the command:</p>  
								<pre> 
<code>SETROPTS RACLIST(CDT) REFRESH</code>
								</pre> Important: 
								<p>Do not delete the installation-defined dynamic class until all of the systems that share the RACF database are IPLed with z/OS V2R4. If you plan to propagate changes to the CDT class by using the RACF remote sharing facility (RRSF), this guidance also applies to systems on remote RRSF nodes.</p>

									<li>Programs that call the ADMN_RUN_COMD function of the R_admin SAF callable service (IRRSEQ00) on the ADDUSER, ALTUSER, or PASSWORD commands, as described here.</li>  
									<li>Programs that call the ADMN_ADD_USER or ADMN_ALT_USER functions of the R_admin SAF callable service (IRRSEQ00) with input parameter lists that are functionally equivalent to the ADDUSER, ALTUSER, or PASSWORD commands, as described here.</li>

					<title>RACF: Ensure that the ECC master key is activated in the CCA coprocessor</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>In RACF, the RACDCERT command is used to manage RACF digital certificates. When you specify RACFDCERT with the RSA(PKDS) keyword for an RSA private key, RACF stores the RSA private key in the ICSF PKA key data set (PKDS).</p>  
						<p>Starting in z/OS V2R4, the RSA private key is stored in PKDS under a more secure master key that is called the ECC master key (32 bytes). In previous releases, the RSA private key was stored in PKDS under a 24-byte master key called the RSA master key. With this change, you must ensure that the ECC master key is activated in the CCA coprocessor. Otherwise, the RACDCERT command that attempting to store an RSA key in PKDS fails with an error.</p>  
						<p>This change is intended to help maintain strong security in your enterprise. It also supports the generation of a new signature algorithm on certificates that are used for TLS1.3, which is introduced in z/OS V2R4.</p>

							<li>Equifax Secure Certificate Authority</li>  
							<li>ICP-Brasil Certificate Authority - Version 1</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>In previous releases, these certificates were provided as a convenience, so that you would not need to define them. As shipped, the certificates were not connected to any key ring and were defined as untrusted, by default.</p>  
						<p>However, some z/OS installations preferred not to have extra CA certificates in their systems. Though it is possible to delete the unwanted CA certificates, RACF recreated the default list of CA certificates after every system IPL. Therefore, to delete the CA certificates, it was necessary to delete them after each IPL.</p>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R3, the number of RACF supplied CA certificates is reduced to the following set:</p>  
						<dl> 
							<dt>STG Code Signing Certificate Authority certificate</dt>  
							<dd>Issued by IBM for RACF program signature verification for V2R1 and earlier.</dd>  
							<dt>STG Code Signing Certificate Authority – G2 certificate</dt>  
							<dd>Issued by IBM for RACF program signature verification for V2R2 and later.</dd>  
							<dt>GeoTrust Global Certificate Authority certificate</dt>  
							<dd>Required for the SMP/E process.</dd> 
						</dl>  
						<p>If your installation uses one or more of the removed CA certificates, you might have a upgrade action to perform. See

						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>To install the database template updates, run the IRRMIN00 utility with PARM=UPDATE.</p> Tip: 
						<p>The RACF database templates are updated for z/OS V2R4. The templates initially contain a version string with the value 
							<code>HRF77C0 00000223.00000050</code>.
						</p> Note: 
						<p>If IRRMIN00 produces a return code of 4 and message 
							<code>IRR8025 PARM=UPDATE specified, but template update not required</code>, you do not necessarily have a problem. Check that your JCL refers to the new level of IRRMIN00. If so, you can ignore the return code and warning message. Possibly, a previous PTF already updated your templates to the current level for the new release. Otherwise, if your JCL refers to an old copy of IRRMIN00, correct the JCL and run IRRMIN00 again.

					<title>TSO/E: Check for programs that expect RC 0 for invalid command invocations</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>Usually, when a command is not found or fails, TSO/E command processing responds with return code 12 (RC12). However, for one type of command error, in which the command name exceeds 8 characters or contains an invalid character, TSO/E command processing responds with return code zero (RC 0).</p>  
						<p>In z/OS V2R4, this behavior is corrected. TSO/E command processing is updated to return RC 12 for situations in which the command name exceeds 8 characters or contains an invalid character.</p>  
						<p>This change in behavior applies to the following types of processing:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>CLIST processing in which the return code is checked in the 
								<code>&amp;LASTCC</code> variable
							</li>  
							<li>Batch TMP jobs that use conditional processing that is based on return code.</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>For example, in previous releases, the command ABCDEFGH# receives return code 0 and the message:</p>  
						<pre> 
<code>IKJ56621I INVALID COMMAND NAME SYNTAX</code>
						</pre>  
						<p>As of z/OS V2R4, the command ABCDEFGH# receives return code 12 and the same message.</p>

						<p>As of z/OS V2R4, the Server-Requester Programming Interface (SRPI) is no longer supported. This API was introduced in TSO/E in the 1980s to provide a programming interface that enhances the environment of IBM workstations communicating with IBM mainframes running z/OS.</p>

					<title>z/OS UNIX: Migrate from HFS file systems to zFS file systems</title>  
					<description><![CDATA[  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Description</h5>  
						<p>z/OS V2R4 is the last release of the z/OS operating system to support the hierarchical file system (HFS) data structure used by the z/OS UNIX environment. IBM provides equivalent if not superior functionality with the z/OS File System (zFS). Your installation should migrate from HFS to zFS. To convert your file system hierarchy to zFS, use the utilities that are provided in the operating system.</p>  
						<p>After z/OS V2R4, you can no longer mount a data structure that is DSNTYPE=HFS.</p>  
						<p>Before z/OS V1R7, the HFS file system was the primary hierarchical file system. As of z/OS V1R7, you can use any combination of HFS and zFS file systems. Because zFS has higher performance characteristics than HFS and is the strategic file system, you should migrate your HFS file systems to zFS.</p>  
						<p>The HFS and zFS file system types in mount statements and command operands are now generic file system types that can mean either HFS or zFS. Based on the data set type, the system determines which is appropriate. However, note that you must still specify a type (HFS or zFS and it cannot be defaulted). If the type you specify is not correct for the file system that is being mounted, any associated parameter string setting in the mount statement or command is ignored, even though the system sets the type correctly and processes the mount.</p>

						</table>  
						<h5 class="title sectiontitle">Steps to take</h5>  
						<p>Follow these steps:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Before beginning the migration, do the following: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Establish backout procedures.</li>  
									<li>Decide on naming conventions.</li>  
									<li>Decide on unavailability.</li>  
									<li>Understand any cloning or deployment changes that are required by zFS systems being linear data sets. Considerations would include any copy utility invocations, BPXPRMxx specifications for symbolics, and placement of zFS file systems on system volumes.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Perform the conversion from an HFS to zFS file system. 
								<p>You can use the BPXWH2Z tool to perform the conversion. It is an ISPF-based tool that migrates HFS file systems to zFS file systems. Using its panel interface, you can alter the space allocation, placement, SMS classes, and data set names. A HELP panel is provided. With this tool, you can:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>Migrate HFS file systems (both mounted and unmounted) to zFS file systems. If the HFS being migrated is mounted, the tool automatically unmounts it and then mounts the new zFS file system on its current mount point.</li>  
									<li>Define zFS aggregates by default to be approximately the same size as the HFS. The new allocation size can also be increased or decreased.</li>  
									<li>Have the migration run in TSO/E foreground or UNIX background.</li> 
								</ul>  
								<p>You can use the JCL sample ISPBTCH in SYS1.SAMPLIB to start BPXWH2Z as an ISPF batch job. Before you run the job, read the notes section. When you run BPXWH2Z on your z/OS system, make sure it uses that same z/OS level of the pax command. You can manually migrate from an HFS to zFS file system without using the tool. However, you would need to allocate and format the target zFS file systems.</p>  
								<p> 
									<strong>Requirement</strong>: The BPXWH2Z tool requires the zFS address space to be operational. Therefore, before attempting to migrate existing HFS to zFS file systems by using BPXWH2Z, ensure that the zFS address space is configured and initialized.
								</p> Tip: 
								<p>You can dynamically migrate the HFS sysplex root in a shared file system configuration to zFS while the root is in use, without disrupting workloads. Although the shared file system configuration is required, the sysplex can be a single system.</p> Note: 
								<p>As of z/OS V2R3, you can use the bpxwmigf shell command to migrate HFS file systems to zFS file systems without incurring any interruptions to running workloads. The HFS file system does not have to be unmounted first. bpxwmigf is also available as a TSO/E command or REXX system command. For more information about this command, see 
									<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.bpxa500/abstract.htm">z/OS UNIX System Services Command Reference</a>.
								</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Change policies and scripts, and so on, to reflect the change from the HFS file system to zFS file system. Use the RMF Monitor III option to report on zFS activity. Tip: 
								<p>Use the RMF Monitor III option to report on zFS activity.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>The DDNAME(name) keyword of the BPXPRMxx ROOT and MOUNT statements is not supported by zFS. If you use them. Change these statements to use the FILESYSTEM(name) keyword instead.</li> 
						</ol>  
						<p>Migrating the sysplex root file system from HFS to zFS after IPLing your previous z/OS system:</p>  
						<p>Before you begin the migration:</p>  
						<ul> 
							<li>Ensure that the following requirements are met: 
								<ul> 
									<li>All systems in the sysplex are at the V1R12 level.</li>  
									<li>The current sysplex root file system PFS, and the new sysplex root file system PFS, are up in all the systems in shared file system configuration.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Be aware of the following restrictions: 
								<ul> 
									<li>The current sysplex root file system must be mounted as a read-only file system.</li>  
									<li>The systems that do not meet the requirements for this upgrade action cannot join the sysplex during the sysplex root file system migration processing. However, these systems can join the sysplex after the sysplex root migration is completed.</li>  
									<li>The current sysplex root and the new sysplex root must be either HFS or zFS in any combination. If the new sysplex root is zFS, then it must be HFS-compatible.</li>  
									<li>The sysplex root or any directories on it cannot have been exported by the DFS or SMB server.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Note the following: 
								<ul> 
									<li>Remote NFS mounts of the sysplex root or any directories on it are considered active use of the current sysplex root file system.</li>  
									<li>During the migration, the new zFS sysplex root file system must not be HSM-migrated, mounted, or in use.</li>  
									<li>Mount parameters are preserved during the migration or replacement of the sysplex root file system of the same file system type (PFS). They are dropped if the file system type is different.</li>  
									<li>Directories, data, files, and links are not copied from one file system to another.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li> 
						</ul>  
						<p>Perform the migration as follows:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Ensure that a file system is mounted read-only as the current sysplex root file system. When the root is mounted read-only, there are no function-shipping clients if the physical paths to the DASD are available to each system. To verify that there are no function-shipping clients, enter: 
								<pre> 
<code>D OMVS,F,NAME=root_file_system_name</code>
								</pre>  
								<p>You should see CLIENT=N on each system.</p> 
							</li>  
							<li>Allocate and set up the new zFS sysplex root file system: 
								<ol> 
									<li>Create a zFS file system to be used as the new sysplex root file system. 
										<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ioea700/abstract.htm">z/OS File System Administration</a> discusses creating and managing zFS file systems. 
										<strong>Rules</strong> : 
										<ul> 
											<li>The UID, GID, and permission bits of the root directory in the new sysplex root file system must be same as the root directory in the current sysplex root file system.</li>  
											<li>If the SECLABEL class is active and the MLFSOBJ option is active, the security label for the new zFS file system must match the assumed security label of the current sysplex root file system.</li> 
										</ul> 
									</li>  
									<li>On the new sysplex root file system, set up the active mount points and the symbolic links. The mount points and symbolic links must be the same as the ones on the current sysplex root file system. You can set them up either (1) manually or (2) by using the pax shell command to populate the new sysplex root file system using the existing sysplex root as a source. To do it manually, create a mount point in the existing sysplex root (for example, /newroot) and mount the new sysplex root file system in the MODE(RDWR) on that mount point. After you mount the new sysplex root file system, manually enter MKDIRs and ln -s to create the mount point directories and symbolic links similar to the existing sysplex root file system. The new sysplex root file system must contain all active mount points and symbolic links exactly as on the existing sysplex root file system.</li>  
									<li>Use the pax shell command to populate the new file system, using the existing sysplex root as a source. 
										<strong>Example</strong> : 
										<pre> 
<code>cd / pax -wr -pe -XCM ./ /newroot</code>
										</pre>  
										<p>For more information about using pax to copy data from an HFS file system to a zFS file system, see 
											<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.ioea700/abstract.htm">z/OS File System Administration</a>.
										</p> 
									</li>  
									<li>Unmount the new zFS file system.</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li>On any system in the shared file system configuration, issue: 
								<pre> 
<code>F OMVS,NEWROOT=new.root.file.system.name,COND=&lt;YesNo&gt;</code>
								</pre>  
								<dl> 
									<dt>YES</dt>  
									<dd>Proceed conditionally. The system checks for active usage in the current sysplex root file system and reports the active usage in a BPXF245I message. If file activity is found, the command fails with EBUSY return code and JrActivityFound reason code. If file activity is not found, the command continues processing to replace the sysplex root. YES is the default.</dd>  
									<dt>NO</dt>  
									<dd>Proceed unconditionally. The system checks for active usage in the current sysplex root file system and reports the active usage in a BPXF245I message. Replacement of the sysplex root file system continues.</dd> 
								</dl>  
								<p>The migration of the sysplex root file system begins. During the migration, active connections to files and directories in the current sysplex root file system are broken.</p>  
								<p>After the migration completes:</p>  
								<ul> 
									<li>The root CWD ('/') is updated on all systems in the sysplex to point to the new sysplex root file system.</li>  
									<li>New opens go to the new sysplex root file system. The current sysplex root for the root directory is replaced for all processes in all systems. The current directory for root directory is replaced for any processes that use it</li>  
									<li>Old connections in the previous sysplex root file system might encounter EIO errors.</li> 
								</ul> 
							</li>  
							<li>Update the TYPE parameter and name of the sysplex root file system in the BPXPRMxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB. Because the DDNAME() keyword of the BPXPRMxx ROOT and CMOUNT statements is not supported by zFS, change these statements to use the FILESYSTEM(name) keyword instead.</li>

						<p>If you are using a sysplex root file system, take the following actions:</p>  
						<ol> 
							<li>Rerun the sample REXX EXEC SYS1.SAMPLIB(BPXISYS1) to update the sysplex root, making system installation-specific adjustments. Running the EXEC will create the /global directory in the sysplex root. You do not need to run any sample jobs to create /global in the version root (or root) for a non-sysplex environment because ServerPac will provide that directory during installation. 
								<ol> 
									<li>Alternatively, a system programmer can run the MKDIR command to add the /global directory with permission bits 7,5,5 to an existing sysplex root.</li>  
									<li>At this time, you can also remove an obsolete directory called /..., after verifying that it is an empty directory. This directory was used by DCE, which is no longer shipped in z/OS.</li>  
									<li>If applicable, ensure that the same updates are also made to the alternate sysplex root.</li> 
								</ol> 
							</li>  
							<li>Create a file system that will be mounted on the /global directory.</li>  
							<li>As necessary and as instructed, create additional mount points (and file systems) for exploitation by z/OS functions under /global.</li>
