 IBM z/OS z14 Workflow
=====================

**Helping you to prepare for the IBM z14 server!**

Did you know that you can use a z/OSMF workflow to prepare your z/OS system for migrating to the IBM z14 server?  
This workflow contains interactive steps for migration considerations, restrictions, and actions to take before you order your server, along with a checklist of items that will be discontinued on future servers. 
The workflow contains the same valuable information as the z/OS Migration book, in the topic "Migrate to an IBM z14 server."  You can provide feedback for each step in the Workflow, if you wish.

**Important information**

Transfer the appropriate two files as binary using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and store them in the same z/OS UNIX directory:

    * z14_zOS_Migration-Level1.0.xml
    * HC_rexx.txt
 
We welcome any contributions or feedback on anything you find. Keep in mind, there are no warranties for any of the files or contributions that you find here. This is a z/OS community that is sharing with others and it is expected that you review what you are using in your environment. This tool is not supported by the IBM Service organization, but rather by the tool owner on a best-can-do basis.

Please report any problems, suggestions, or comments to zosmig@us.ibm.com.
