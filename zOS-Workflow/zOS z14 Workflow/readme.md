 IBM z/OS z14 Workflow
=====================

**Helping you to prepare for the IBM z14 server!**

Did you know that you can use a z/OSMF workflow to prepare your z/OS system for migrating to the IBM z14&trade; server?  
This workflow contains interactive steps for migration considerations, restrictions, and actions to take before you order your server, along with a checklist of items that will be discontinued on future servers. 
The workflow contains the same valuable information as the z/OS Migration book, in the topic *"Migrate to an IBM z14 server."*  

You can provide feedback to IBM for any of the steps in the workflow, if you wish.

**What's new**

The IBM z/OS z14 Workflow is updated with new information for the IBM z14 Model ZR1 (z14 ZR1). The z14 ZR1 is the newest addition to the IBM z14 family, and is designed for clients who do not need the capacity of the larger M01-M05 models. To indicate this change, in the workflow definition file, the workflow version tag is updated to Version 2.1.

In the workflow, references to "z14" pertain to all models of the IBM z14, including the z14 Model ZR1, unless otherwise noted.

**Important information**

Transfer the appropriate two files as binary using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and store them in the same z/OS UNIX directory:

    * z14_zOS_Migration-Level1.0.xml
    * HC_rexx.txt
 
We welcome any contributions or feedback on anything you find. Keep in mind, there are no warranties for any of the files or contributions that you find here. This is a z/OS community that is sharing with others and it is expected that you review what you are using in your environment. This tool is not supported by the IBM Service organization, but rather by the tool owner on a best-can-do basis.

Please report any problems, suggestions, or comments to zosmig@us.ibm.com.
