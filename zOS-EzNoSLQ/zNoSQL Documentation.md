# Introduction to EzNoSQL 

EzNoSQL for z/OS provides a comprehensive set of C based Application Progammer Interfaces (APIs), which enable applications to store JSON (UTF-8) documents while utilizing the full data sharing capabilities of IBM's Parallel Sysplex technology and System z operating system (z/OS). The JSON data can be accessed as either non-recoverable, or with recoverable (transactional) consistency across the sysplex. The APIs also allow for the creation of secondary indexes, which provide for faster queries to specific key fields within the JSON data.  

IBM's Parallel Sysplex Coupling Facility (CF) technology, enables separate processors to share a single instance of a database (collection of documents), without the need for data sharding, replicating the updates, or programming for eventual consistency. Additionally, sysplex allows for easy horizontal scalability by adding additional processors (or z/OS instances) as required.  Implementing EzNoSQL on z/OS will inherit many of the desired functions provided by z/OS such as in-memory caching, system managed storage, data encryption, and compression.  EzNoSLQ databases can be shared with other exploiters of VSAM databases defined as DATABASE(JSON).  Refer to the following link for more information on native access to DATABASE(JSON) databases: https://www-40.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zOSV2R4sc236855?OpenDocument (Chapter 14).

## JSON Documents

EzNoSQL is a document oriented data store which accepts UTF-8 JSON documents (analogous to records or rows in other data bases). The JSON documents must meet the format as described by[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). JSON documents consist of an unordered set of `key:value` elements enclosed in brackets, and can be up to 2 gigbytes in size. The document may contain arrays and other imbedded documents:
```
{
 "Customer_id":"4084",
 "Address": {
             "Street":"1 Main Street",
             "City":"New York",
             "State":"NY"
             }
 "Accounts": ["Checking","Savings"]
}
```

## Primary Keys

The EzNoSQL database can be defined with a user supplied primary key, where the chosen key must be contained in each the document and paired with a unique value.

The primary keyname must be less than 256 characters, however, the value size is unrestricted. In the above example, the "Customer_id" keyname may be a good choice for a unique primary key. The value in this case of "4084" becomes the primary key value used to retrieve the document. 

If a unique keyname is not available, the database can be defined without a keyname.  In this case EzNoSQL will auto generate a unique key:value for the document and insert the additional element at the beginning of the document.  The additional element will use a reserved keyname of "znsq_id" and paired witha 120 byte unique character value:
```
{ 
 "znsq_id":"..generatedkeyvalue..",
 "Address": {
             "Street":"1 Main Street",
             "City":"New York",
             "State":"NY"
             }
 "Accounts": ["Checking","Savings"]
}
```
Note that the use of auto generated keys will incur more CPU overhead when compared to providing a primary key for document inserts. 

The inserted documents can then be retrieved directly via the primary keyname and value (e.g.`"Customer_id":"4084"` or `"znsq_id":"..generatedkeyvalue.."`).  Alternatively, all the documents in the database can be retrieved in a consective fashion, beginning either with the first or the last document without providing a keyname value. Retrieving documents in this manner will not return documents in order of the key values.


## Secondary Indexes

Documents may also be retreived or updated through the use of secondary (alternate) indexes. Secondary indexes contain alternate keys, which can be used to retrieve the documents in the database. By creating alternate keys, the application can have more than one option for locating specific documents, or can find groups of like documents much faster than scanning the entire database.  

When creating a secondary index, the application developer assigns the alternate keyname which contains the value to be used as the alternate key. The alternate keynames must be less than 256 characters, however the paired values are not restricted. Secondary indexes must be physically created while the database is fully disconnected (closed), however the activation or deactivation can ocur dynmaically while the database is connected (open) and in use. Consideration should be given when creating secondary indexes, as each additional active index will incur overhead when updating he database.

Assume an EzNoSQL database is created with a primary keyname of "Customer_id", and a secondary index with an alternate keyname of "Address", and contains the following document:
```
{
 "Customer_id":"4084",
 "Address": {
             "Street":"1 Main Street",
             "City":"New York",
             "State":"NY"
             }
 "Accounts": ["Checking","Savings"]
}
```

The document can now be retrieved either through the primary index using a keyname of "Customer_id" and a value of "4084", or via the secondary index using a keyname of "address" and a value of `{Street":"1 Main Street","City":"New York","State":"NY"}`.  When updating documents, all secondary (active) indexes will be updated to reflect the `key:value` changes from the new version of the document.  

When secondary index keynames are paired with an array, alternate keys will be generated for all the values in the array.  For example, a secondary keyname of "Accounts" would allow the above document to be retrieved using a value of "Checking" or "Savings".  For a primary keyname, only the first value in the array will be used as the primary key. 


### Active Secondary Indexes

Secondary indexes are created inactive by default and only while the database is disconnected.  The index can then be built and activated by adding the index at any point in time after the creation of the index.  Note that time it takes to build an index is relative to how large the database is.  All active indexes are updated when new documents are inserted, erased, or updated via the primary or any of the other (active) secondary indexes.  If a secondary index is no longer required, it can made be switched to inactive (quiesced) across the sysplex.

Once a secondary index is switched to inactive, it will no longer be updated and may become down level (out of sync) with the documents in the database.  While an index is inactive, any requests to access documents via the inactive index will be failed.  Switching the index to inactive will remove the addtional overhead of maintaining the index.  Inactive indexes can be re-activated and rebuilt by re-adding the index.  


### NonUnique Secondary Indexes

Secondary indexes can be defined as unique or non-unique.  For unique indexes, each value must be unique or a duplicate key error is returned. The primary index is always a unique index.  For non-unique secondary indexes, the value can be used to retrieve all the documents which contain the same value. EzNoSQL will return a reason code informing the application when more than on documents exist for the alternate key.     


## Multi Level Keys

Both the primary and secondary indexes can have a single level keyname, or can have a multiple level keyname (referred to as a multikey). The indiviual levels are connected by the reverse solidus character \.  For example, a secondary keyname of "Address\Steet" would allow the following document to be retrieved using a value of "1 Main Street".
```
{
 "Customer_id":"4084",
 "Address": {
             "Street":"1 Main Street",
             "City":"New York",
             "State":"NY"
             }
 "Accounts": ["Checking","Savings"]
}
```

Multikey names can also span into imbedded documents or an array of imbedded documents.  For example, creating a secondary index with a keyname of "Employee\Name" will allow the following document to be retrieved by either a value of "John Smith" or "Fred Jones":
```
{
 "_id:":'0001',
 "Employee":[{"Name":"John Smith"},
             {"Name":"Fred Jones"}]  
}  
```

## Document Retrieval

Documents can be directly read, updated, or erased by specifying the desired keyname and value of the specific document to be retrieved/updated.  Additionally, documents can be retrieved in an ordered fashion through the use of secondary indexes.  The application can position (znsq_position) into the secondary index to a specific key value, or for any value greater than or equal to the desired key range. The documents can then be be retrieved in a (sequential) ascending or descending order, and optionally updated (znsq_update_result) or deleted (znsq_delete_result) following the retrieval. When using sequential access to update or erase documents, the documents will not be visable on disk and to other sharers until either:  the end of the buffer is reached, a znsq_close_result is issued, or a successful close of the data base.  When a znsq_close_result is issue, positioning is ended and a new znsq_position must be issued to re-establish position within the secondary index.  EzNoSQL will return a reason code when reading alternate (non-unique) duplicate keys.

In order to iterate in an order fashion over the primary key, and optionally update/delete the document(s), use a direct read (znsq_read) with the update option for the primary key.  Then optionally update (znsq_update_result), detelete (znsq_delete_result), or end the update (close_result). 

While the alternate key value size is not restricted, the keys will be truncated after 251 bytes. Truncated keys may result in non-unique keys with other keys containing the same first 251 bytes.  Sequentially reading truncated keys may return the documents out of order and require further sorting by the application. EzNoSQL will return a reason code alerting the application if a truncated key is retrieved.  


## Recoverable Data Sets

The recoverablity of a database determines the duration of the locking and the transactional (atomic) capabilities when accessing documents in and across EzNoSQL database. EzNoSQL will obtain a document level exclusive lock for any type of update (write, update, or delete) of a document, and an optional shared lock for reads:  

* Non-recoverable databases are created using the default log options(NONE) parameter.  When the database is created with the NONE options, the document level locks are held only for the duration of the update or read.  For any type of update, the document level lock is obtained exclusively and protects the document from multiple (simultaneous) updates.  For reads, by default there is no read integrity (NRI).  With NRI, the latest version of the document is returned at the time of the read. Optionally shared locks may be obtained to provide a consist read which will protect a reader from viewing the document in the middle of an update. The shared locks may be obtained only for the duration of the read (CR) or for the duration of the transaction (CRE).  Obtaining shared locks may incur overhead and should be used only when required. 

* Recoverable databases are created using the log options(UNDO or ALL) parameter.  The UNDO option logs the before image of the document to an undo log for backing out a failed transaction, while the ALL option adds the logging of the after image to a forward recovery log for recovering a damaged data set. When the database is created with the UNDO or ALL option, the document level locks (exclusive or CRE shared locks) are held for the duration of the transaction and only released after a successful commit or abort.  A transaction is started and assigned a unit of work (UOW) id when the first update is made to any EzNoSQL database under the current task.  The transaction can then be explicitly committed or backed out by the application via the EzNoSQL APIs.  Following a commit or abort, the next update will start a new transaction id.
 
For recoverable databases, an optional autocommit can be requested by the application at open/connection time.  The autocommit option will generate a commit after every update.  Autocommit is active by default at open time, however, the option can be switched on or off at any time while the task is connected to the database. Note that frequent commits can cause additional overhead when updating the database, while in-frequent commits can cause record lock contention with other sharers of the database.  

If the task ends normally without a commit for the last transaction, an implicit commit will be issued by EzNoSQL. If the task ends abnormally without a commit following the last transaction, an implicit backed out will be issue by EzNoSQL.  Transactions which fail to abort will be shunted, and the locks owned by the transaction will be retained until the issue preventing the abort is resolved.  Using the log options ALL parameter adds forward recovery logging for the database and requires a forward recovery log to be assigned to the database.


# System Requirements 

## Hardware Software Requirements

EzNoSQL executes in an IBM Parallel Syplex configuration.  Refer to https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=mvs-zos-setting-up-sysplex  for more information on configuring a Parallel Sysplex. The minimum hardware/software configuration for zNoSQL requires:
1. at least one logical partition (LPAR), running IBM's Version 2.4 z/OS operating system or above in plexmode with APAR OA62553.
2. at least one internal or external Coupling Facility (CF) attached to the LPAR(s) (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=PR%2FSM+Planning+Guide). 
EzNoSQL is provided with z/OS and does not require any additonal software licences.  

## Storage Administration Requirements 

1. Enable the SMSVSAM address space on each LPAR which will access the EzNoSQL databases. If recoverable EzNoSQL databases will be accessed, the DFSMS Transaction VSAM (TVS) manager must be enabled and configured including the availability of foward recovery logstreams if required by the application (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=administration-administering-vsam-record-level-sharing, or https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246105.html_- (Chapters 5 and 6).
2. Configure one or more SMS storage classes (STORCLAS) containing a CACHESET (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=sharing-defining-storage-classes-vsam-rls#dscrls). The CACHESET identifies the name of one or more CF cache structures for use by the EzNoSQL databases (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=sharing-defining-vsam-rls-attributes-in-data-classes).
3. If SMS guranteed space (GS) storage classes are implemented, the associated storage group (STORGRP) must contain 59 candidate volumes. 
4. Provide the name of the SMS STORLCAS name to the application architect for use in creating the databases, or it can be assigned dynamically by the system through the use of SMS Access Control System (ACS) (https://www-40.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zOSV2R5SC236860/$file/idas200_v2r5.pdf (Chapter 13).
5. Create or assign a database high level qualifer to the application developer for use in assigning database names for the EzNoSQL databases
6. Optionally create SMS data classes (DATACLAS) to enable additional system functions such as encryption, data compression, SMSVSAM 64 bit buffering, and control of space allocation amounts.  Provide the name of the DATACLAS to the application architect for use when defining the database, or it can be assigned dynamically by the system through the use of SMS Access Control System (ACS) (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=attributes-defining-shareoptions-rls-data-class#dorlsadc). 
7. Optionally create SMS management classes (MGMTCLAS) to provide backup and data retention requirements for the EzNoSQL data. Provide the name of the MGMTCLAS to the application architect for use when defining the database, or it can be assigned dynamically by the system through the use of SMS Access Control System (ACS) (link).

## Application Requirements:

Contact your system administrator for requirements when creating EzNoSQL databases:
1. High level qualifier(s) for database names
2. STORCLAS name if not assigned by the system.  A STORCLAS name is required to be assigned or the creation of the database will fail
3. DATACLAS name if not assigned by the system for optional features (i.e. encryption, compression, storing data in the CF global cache) if required by the application
4. MGMTCLAS name if not assigned by the system for application requirements related to data backup frequency and data retention   

# Performance Considerations

## In-Memory Caching

EzNoSQL databases are accessed via the Record Level Sharing (RLS) function on the z/OS servers. RLS provides a 3 tier storage hierarchy which includes: 
 1. local real memory buffering
 2. global Coupling Facility (CF) caching
 3. physical disk storage

When a JSON document is read from the database, the local buffer pool is initially searched for an existing (valid) buffer which contains the desired document.  If the buffer is not found (or tested to be invalid), the CF cache is then searched and if found loaded into the local buffer pool.  If the buffer is not found in the CF cache, a physical i/o is issued to disk, and the buffer is (optionally) loaded into the CF cache and local buffer pool.  Once a buffer is loaded into the CF cache, other sharing LPARs can avoid a physical i/o by accessing the CF copy of the buffer.  

When a JSON document is written to the database, the buffer potentially containing the document is first located as described by the read logic above. Once a buffer is located or created new, the JSON docunment is inserted into the buffer, (optionally) written to the CF, then always written to disk.  Updated/inserted documents are always written to disk, or a non-zero return code is returned to the application indicating the write did not complete.  The write to the CF and to disk is serialized by RLS, and the buffer is cross invalidated to any sharing LPARs.  
 
Optionally, the loading of data into the CF cache may be bypassed and reduce overhead if global caching is not required (for example in a single LPAR configuration).  The RLSCFCACHE option in the SMS DATACLAS controls which buffers are loaded into the CF on behalf of the database.  When electing to cache data in the CF, separate cache structures can be assigned to different groups of databases.  Separate cache sturctures can provide more consistent performance by providing isolation from other RLS data.  Contact the z/OS Storage Administrator for caching requirements. 

# Getting Started 

The EzNoSQL APIs can be called from application user programs running in either 31-bit or 64-bit mode.  The user programs can link to the required executables and side decks directly from z/OS USS directories.  This section explains the required files along with their location and description. Additionally, a sample user program, containing compile and link instructions, is provided to help test the system configuration and to gain familiarity with a subset of the available APIs.  The full suite of available APIs are detailed in the following sections.

## Executables and Side Decks 

The following table shows the names and locations of the EzNoSQL executables, side decks, and sample program:

| Member              | Location              | Description                           |

## Sample Application Program
 
Sample user program: /samples/ibm/igwznsqsamp1.c, is a 31-bit user program which does the following sequence of API calls:
1)  Create a one megabyte JSON (non-recoverable) EzNoSQL database with a primary key of `"_id"`.
3)  Create a one megabyte non-unique secondary index with a key of `"Author"`.
4)  Connect (open) the database.
5)  Insert three documents with identical key values for `"Author":"J. R. R. Tolkien"`.
6)  Position to the top of the secondary index and read all three documents sequentially. 
7)  Disconnect (close) the data base.
8)  Destroy the database.

## Compile and Link Procedure

To compile and link the sample program `/samples/ibm/igwznsqsamp1.c`:  
xlc -c -qDLL -qcpluscmt -qLSEARCH="//'SYS1.SCUNHF'" igwznsqsamp1.c   
xlc -o igwznsqsamp1 igwznsqsamp1.o -W l,DLL /usr/lib/libigwznsqd31.x 

# Application Programming Tiers 

The following section lists the EzNoSQL Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available to the application architect. The APIs are classified in four tiers:
1. *Data Management* - APIs to create, destroy, disable, and report on the EzNoSQL databases and associated indexes.  
2. *Connection Management* - APIs to establish a connection to the EzNoSQL database, or disconnect the connection when access is no longer required.
3. *Document Management* - APIs to write, delete, update, read, commit, and abort documents in the EzNoSQL databases.
4. *Document Retrieval* - APIs to position within the database and sequentially browse the documents via associated indexes.

## Data Management

APIs in the Data Management section must run in task mode and non cross memory mode.

### znsq_create

`int znsq_create(const char * dsname, const znsq_create_options * options );`

#### Create EzNoSQL Database
Creates an EzNoSQL primary index database with the name specified in parameter *dsname* using the attributes that are specified by the *options* parameter. Note that EzNoSQL databases can also be created through other system APIs and are compatible and sharable with the EzNoSQL APIs.  
​
#### Parameters
`dsname`
   C-string containing the name of the database. The name consists of 1 to 44 ebcdic characters divided by one or up to 22 segements. Each name segment (qualifier) is 1 to 8 characters, the first of which must be alphabetic (A to Z) or national (# @ $).  The remaining seven characters are either alphabetic, numeric (0 - 9), national, a hyphen (-). Name segments are separated by a period (.). Example: MY.JSON.DATA. 
​
`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_create_options`](znsq_create_options), where the database attributes are provided.
​
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 
​
If the database was created, the return code is 0.
​
If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 2 and 3 of the return code.
​​
#### struct znsq_create_options
`znsq_create_options;`
​
#### Member attributes
| member            | type                          | description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| version           | `int`                         | API version.                                                                                                         |
| znsq_format       | `format`                      | Database format. Specify 0 (default) for JSON. Currently, only JSON is supported.                                    |
| max_space         | `int`                         | Maximum space of database in mega bytes (required). Additional space will be added per document for system metadata and generated keys:</br>Keyed:.....................................x'AC' bytes</br>Auto generated Keyed:....x'132' bytes</br>Refer to section Primary keyed vs Auto-generated keyed databases for information on this option. | 
| avg_doc_size      | `int`                         | Average size of all documents in the database.  Providing an accurate size as close as possible may improve                     performance when reading/writing to the database.  A zero value will result in a default physical blocksize of 32768.|

      create_options.storclas = storclas;
      create_options.primary_key = keyname;  
      
      return_code = znsq_create(
        dsname,
        &create_options
      );

      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Unexpected return code received from znsq_create()");
        Ilog("Return code from znsq_create(): X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        variation_rc = 1;
        break;
      }
```

### znsq_create_index

`int znsq_create_index(const char *alternate_key, unsigned int flags,const znsq_create_index_options *options) `   
                   
#### Create EzNoSQL Secondary Index
Creates a secondary index with for the name specified in parameters *altname*, using a keyname of *altkey*.  The database to be associated with this index is specifed in the *dsname* parameter.  Together, the secondary index and database are assoicated by the *pathname* parameter.  The pathname is used internally by EzNoSQL to identify the correct association of the secondary index to its base database. The secondary index is created in an inactive state, and must activated via the znsq_add_index API before attempting to access documents via the specified altkeys. For EzNoSQL databases created as recoverable (znsq_log_options=UNDO/ALL), a commit will be issued for any active transation following the build of the index. Note that EzNoSQL databases can also be created through other system APIs and are compatible and shareable with the EzNoSQL APIs.

#### Parameters
  
 `alternate_key` 
   C-string containing the name of the UTF-8 JSON C-string providing the secondary keyname for the index. The string must be < 256 bytes including quotes and end in one byte of x'00'.  The keyname may consists of a multi level name.  Refer to section Multi Level Keynames for more information on this option. 
   
 `flags`
   1 (= (1 << 0)) indicates the creation of a unique index. Non-Unique indexes may contain alternate keys representing one or more documents, while unique indexes ensure only one document is represented by each key.  Attempting to insert duplicate documents with the same alternate key into a unique index will result in a
                  duplicate document error. Refer to section entitled Unique vs Non-Unique Indexes for more information on this topic. 
		  
   2 (=(1 << 1))  indicates descending sequential access when retrieving documents through this index. Refer to section Direct vs Sequential Document Retrieval for more
                  information on this topic.
  ​
`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_add_index_options`](znsq_add_index_options), where the database attributes are provided.

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If the database was created, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 2 and 3 of the return code.

#### struct znsq_create_index_options

### znsq_destroy

`int znsq_destroy(const char *dsname);`

#### Destroy EzNoSQL Database
Destroys an EzNoSQL primary and/or secondary index databases previously created with the name specified in parameter *dsname*.  A znsq_close must be issued for all previous opens whether issued via EzNoSQL or other API's sharing the database.
​
#### Parameters
`dsname`
   C-string containing the name of the previously created EzNoSQL database. 
 
#### Return value
The return code of the function.  

If the database was destroyed, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 2 and 3 of the return code.

### znsq_report_stats   

`int znsq_report_stats(znsq_connection_t con, const char *buf, size_t buff_len);`

#### Create EzNoSQL usage report

Use the znsq_report_stats API to generate a JSON document containing the attributes and usage information for all the indexes associated with the data set, along with information related to the specific connection by the application. A connection to the data set via the znsq_open API is required proir to calling this API.  

#### Parameters:  

`znsq_connection_t` 
  The znsq_connection_t represents the connection token previously returned by the znsq_open API.

`*buf`     
  The buf parameter is a required input parameter containing a pointer to a buffer which will contain the generated JSON report document.
  
`buff_len`
  The buff_len is a required input/output parameter pointing to the length of the buf area.  The initial size of the buffer can be calculated as 453 bytes for the primary index, and 346 bytes for each secondary index added to the EzNoSQL database.  If the buffer is too small, a reason code of x'119' is returned along with the required size in this parameter.

Example call to `znsq_report_stats`:
```
      return_code = znsq_report_stats(
        connection,
        &buf_len,
        buf
      );

      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Unexpected return code received from znsq_report_stats()");
        Ilog("Return code from znsq_report_stats(): X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        variation_rc = 1;
        break;
      }
```

Example format of the returned JSON report document:
```                    
                       {"name":"MY.JSON.DATA",                                  <== Name of the EzNoSQL primary index

## Connection Management

APIs in the Connection Management section, must run in task mode and non cross memory mode.

### znsq_open  

`int znsq_open(znsq_connection_t *con, const char *dsname, unsigned int flags, const struct znsq_open_options *options);`

#### Establishes an open connection to an EzNoSQL database 
Opens an EzNoSQL database by establishing a connection between the user's task and the database.  Additionally, the open API establishes the optional parameters to be used on behalf of this connection, such as read integrity, lock timeout, auto commit, read only, write force, and read access direction for the primary index:

Additional connections can be established as needed by the same user task, or other tasks executing across the sysplex. Additional connections allow for the use of different options, or to load balance the workload across different processors.  A successful open returns a connection token which must be provided on other APIs for reading and writing to the database.

#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant which will contain the connection token after a successful open.    

`dsname` 
   C-string containing the name of the primary database name specified on a prior create or other system API.

`flags`
   1 (= (1 << 0)) indicates read only access is requested for this connection.  Read level security access to the database will be checked, and all write requests will fail. 
                  
   2 (=(1 << 1))  indicates write force is used when attempting to insert a document with a duplicate keyname either for the primary or a unique secondary index. The document is replaced instead of receiving a duplicate document error.   
                  
   3 (=(1 << 2))  indicates descending sequential access when retrieving documents through the primary index. Refer to section Direct vs Sequential Document Retrieval for more information on this topic.
                     ​
`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_open_options`](znsq_open_options), where the open options are provided.

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If the database was created, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 2 and 3 of the return code.

#### struct znsq_open_options

| znsq_boolean      | `enum`                        | The boolean auto commit option specifies if EzNoSQL will issue a commit after any type of update (write, update, erase), or a read integrity extended (CRE) request on behalf if the user. If this option is omitted, then commits will be performed by the system after each update or CRE read. Note that commits are required only for databases created with the log_options of undo or all, or for reads with the use of the CRE option. Commiting after every update request can incur overhead compared to optimizing commits for larger groups of updates. Conversely, commiting to infrequently can impact other sharers of the database from accessing the locked documents:</br>0 indicates auto commit (default)</br>1 indicates auto commit</br>2 indicates no auto commit</br>Refer to section Non-Recoverable vs Recoverable Databases for information on this option. |

Example of opening an EzNoSQL database:
```
      char* base_name = "MY.JSON.DATA";                            //  Database name for primary index created with znsq_create
      znsq_connection_t connection = 0;                            //  Initialize returned connection token
      unsigned int open_flags = 0;                                 //  Initialize open flags
      znsq_open_options.znsq_timeout = 5;                          //  Timeout lock waiters after 5 seconds
      znsq_open_options.znsq_boolean = 1;                          //  Auto commit after ever update 
            
      #define FLAG_READ_ONLY       (1 << 0)                        //  Read only                           
      #define FLAG_FORCE_WRITE     (1 << 1)                        //  Force writes
      #define FLAG_DESCENDING_KEYS (1 << 2)                        //  Descending access to primary index
      
      open_flags = FLAG_FORCE_WRITE;                                //  Set flags to write force on
       
      return_code = znsq_open(
                    &connection, 
		    dsname,
		    open_flags,
		    &open_options
	          );

      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Unexpected return code received from znsq_open()");
        Ilog("Return code from znsq_open(): X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        variation_rc = 3;
        break;
     }         
```

### znsq_close   

Closes the connection to the EzNoSQL database previously established by a znsq_open.  

`int znsq_close(znsq_connection_t con);`

#### Parameters

znsq_connection_t      The znsq_connection_t represents the connection token previously returned by the znsq_open API.  

Example of closing an EzNoSQL database:
```
      return_code = znsq_close(connection);                        // Connection token returned by znsq_open       

      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Unexpected return code received from znsq_close()");
        Ilog("Return code from znsq_close(): X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        variation_rc = 6;
        break;
      }
```

## Document Retrievel 

APIs in the Data Retrieval section provide direct and sequential retrievals/updates/deletes of EzNoSQL documents.

### znsq_read    

`int znsq_read(znsq_connection_t con, const char *buf, size_t *buf_len, const char *key, const char *key_value, unsigned int flags, znsq_read_options *options);`

#### direct read documents 
Issues a direct read for a previously added document using the key name and key_value specified on the read request.  The key name must match the name on a previously issued znsq_create, znsq_create_index, or a generated "znsq_id" element. The value must match a previously added key_value paired with the specified
key, otherwise a document not found error is returned.  

The read request can opt to retrieve the document for update which will obtain an exclusive lock and return a result set token representing ownership of the lock.  The result set token must then be used to issue an update, delete, or end result for the document via znsq_update_result, znsq_delete_result,
of znsq_close_result APIs.  For non-recoverable databases, the lock will be released following the update or delete request.  For recoverable databases, the lock will be released by the znsq_commit or znsq_abort APIs.  
               
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open.    

`buf` 
   contains a buffer to receive the JSON document following a success read.

`buff_len` 
   contains the length of the buffer to receive the document.  The buffer may be larger than the returned document, however, if the buffer is to small to contain the document, a x'51' error is returned to the caller along with the required buffer length. For successful reads, the actual length of the document is returned.  

`key` 
   C-string containing the keyname associated with either the primary or a secondary index and ending with one byte of x'00'.

`key_value` 
   value for the specific document to be retrieved.  

`flags`
   1 (= (1 << 0)) indicates read for update.  A read with the update option will obtain a document level lock exclusively and return a token in the result_set. 

`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_read_options`](znsq_read_options), where the read options are provided.
   
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful read, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

### znsq_position  

`int znsq_position(znsq_connection_t con, znsq_result_set_t *result_set, const char *key,
            const char *key_value, enum znsq_search_method search_method,
			unsigned int flags);`
	    
			
#### Position to a key within the EzNoSQL database 
Issues a request to locate a specific key value (or a key value greater than or equal to) the desired key range. When the key value length is zero, positioning will be to the first or last document in the database based on the search order parameter: a search order (specifed with the znsq_open API)Ez of forward (default) will position to the first document, while backward will position to the last document. Following a successful position, a result_set token is returned which is then used as input for subsequent sequential retrieves or updates/deletes.  Positioning is therefore required prior to issuing the znsq_next_result, znsq_update_result, or the znsq_delete_result APIs.  Postioning should be terminated by using the znsq_close_result API in order to release the result_set.
            
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open.  
   
`znsq_result_set_t'
`   int32_t token returned following the successful completion of the API and used for subsequent read, update, or delete result APIs.    

`key` 
   C-string containing the keyname associated with either the primary or a secondary index and ending with one byte of x'00'.

`key_value` 
   C-string containing the value for the specific document to be retrieved.

`znsq_search_method`  
   1  indicates that the first (or last) document equal to specified key_value should be located for subsequent sequential retrieves/updates/deletes.
   2  indicates that the first (or last) document greater than or equal to the specified key_value should be located for sequential retrieves/updates/deletes.

`flags`
   Reserved for future use.
   
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful position, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of positioning to document from an EzNoSQL database:
```
     char keyname[] = {0x22, 0x5f, 0x69, 0x64, 0x22, 0x00};                 //  "_id" in utf-8  225F696422
     char key_value[] = {0x22, 0x30, 0x31, 0x22, 0x00};                     //  "01" 
     int32_t position_keyname_len = strlen(keyname);                        //  Key name length
     int32_t Position_keyname_val_len = strlen(key_value);                  //  Key value length
     char* position_keyname_ptr = (char*) malloc(read_keyname_val_len);     //  Pointer to keynane
     char* Position_keyname_val_ptr = (char*) malloc(read_keyname_val_len); //  Pointer to value      
     strncpy(position_keyname_ptr, keyname, position_keyname_val_len);      //  Copy keyname 
     strncpy(keyname_val_ptr, key_value, read_keyname_val_len);             //  Copy value                                        
     
     #define VSAMDB_KEY_EQUAL (1 << 0)                                      //  Set position to the first document with the specified key_value 
      
     return_code = znsq_position(
        connection,
	&rs,
        position_keyname_ptr,
        VSAMDB_KEY_EQUAL,            
        NULL
       );	

      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Error returned from znsq_position()");
        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));

### znsq_next_result    
`int znsq_next_result(znsq_connection_t con, znsq_result_set_t *result_set, const char *buf, size_t *buf_len, unsigned int flags);`
  
#### sequential retrieval of documents by ascending/descending key value 
Issues a sequential read for the next key value based on the search order specified in the znsq_open API. Prior to reading sequentially, a znsq_position must be issued to create the result_set token representing the starting key value.  The result_set token is used as input for each sequential read in order to receive the document in the user provided buffer. The znsq_close_result API is used to end the positioning into the key range. Note that depending on the read integrity option specified in the znsq_open API, shared locks maybe obtained for each retrievel, and for CRE held until a commit is issued.  

The read request can opt to retrieve the documents for update which will obtain an exclusive lock. The result set token must then be used to issue an update, delete, or end result for the document via znsq_update_result, znsq_delete_result, or znsq_close_result APIs.  For non-recoverable databasess, the lock will be released following the update or delete request.  For recoverable databases, the lock will be released by the znsq_commit, znsq_abort APIs, or the end of the task.  
               
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open. 
   
`znsq_result_set_t'
`   int32_t token returned from a previous successful znsq_position or znsq_next_result.       

`buf` 
   contains a buffer to receive the JSON document following a success read.

`buff_len` 
   contains the length of the buffer to receive the document.  If the buffer is to small to contain the document, a x'51' error is 
   returned to the caller along with the required buffer length.  

`flags`
   1 (= (1 << 0)) indicates read for update.  A read with the update option will obtain a document level lock exclusively and return a token in the result_set. 
   
`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_next_result options`](znsq_next_result_options), where the next result options are provided.

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful read, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of reading documents sequentially from an EzNoSQL database:
```
     unsigned int next_result_flags = 0;
     char *read_buf = calloc(200, 1);                                  //  Buffer for returned document
     size_t read_buf_len = strlen(read_buf);                           //  Buffer length
     int32_t read_keyname_len = strlen(keyname);                       //  Key name length 
     int32_t read_keyname_val_len = strlen(key_value);                 //  Key_Value length
     char* read_buf_ptr = (char*) malloc(read_buf_len);                //  Pointer to returned document     
           
     #define FLAG_READ_UPDATE       (1 << 1)                           //  Read for update                         
     next_result_flags = FLAG_READ_UPDATE;                             //  Set flag to read forupdate 
      
     return_code = znsq_next_result(
        connection,
	&rs,
        read_buf_ptr,
        &read_buf_len,
        next_result_flags
       );
        
      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Error returned from znsq_next_result()");
        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        free(read_buf_ptr);
        break;
      }
```   

### znsq_close_result    
`int znsq_close_result(znsq_connection_t con, znsq_result_set_t result);`
  
#### Close Result 
Ends positioning into the EzNoSQL database previously established by the znsq_position API.  The result_set (provided as input) is invalidated, and for non-recoverable databases, any document level locks will be released.  A new znsq_position must be issued to restart seqential retrievals following the close result. 
               
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open.    

`znsq_result_set_t'
`   int32_t token returned from previous znsq_position.    
   
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful read, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of ending positioning with znsq_close_result:
```             
     return_code = znsq_next_result(
        connection,
	&rs);
        
      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Error returned from znsq_close_result()");
        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        break;
      }
```   

## Document Management

APIs in the Document Management section must run in non cross memory mode.

### znsq_write   
`int znsq_write(znsq_connection_t con, const char *buf, size_t buff_len,
             znsq_write_options *options);`

#### Write new documents 
Writes (inserts) new documents into the EzNoSQL database using the keyname (optionally) specified on the write.  Whether the keyname represents the primary or a secondary index, all indexes are updated to reflect the new values found in the document. For a keyed EzNoSQL database, the keyname on the write must match the 
keyname specifed on the create.  If the key value was previously added to the database, then a duplicate document error is returned, unless the write force option
was specified on the znsq_open API. 

I the keyname option is ommitted, the database is assumed to be an auto-generated keyed database, and will generate a new key:value element for the document (refer to the section Primary keyed vs Auto-generated keyed databases for more information on this topic).  If the document contains an auto-generated key element from a 
prior write request, a duplicate document error will be returned unless the write force option was specified on the znsq_open API.  

If the auto-commit option is active for the connection, then a commit will be issued following a successful write.   

#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open.    

`buf` 
   contains the JSON document followed by an ending delimter of x'00'.

`buff_len` 
   contains the length of the document.   
   
`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_write_options`](znsq_write_options), where the database attributes are provided.

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If the database was created, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 2 and 3 of the return code.

#### Delete Documents 
Deletes (erases) existing documents from an EzNoSQL database using the provided primary or secondary key name and paired key_value.  An exclusive document level lock will be obtained for the delete request.  For non-recoverable datasets, the lock will be released immediately following the request, and for recoverable databases, the lock will be released by a znsq_commit, znsq_abort, or when the task ends. All secondary indexes will be updated to relect any alternate key deletions when the document is deleted.

`znsq_result_set_t'
`   int32_t token returned from a previous successful completion of a znsq_read or znsq_next_result with the update options specified.         

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If the database was created, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of a delete result for a document from an EzNoSQL database:

   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open.    

`newbuf` 
   contains a copy of the updated document to replace the existing version of the document.  All secondary indexes will be updated to relect any alternate key changes found in the  new version of the document.

`key` 
   C-string containing the keyname associated with either the primary or a secondary index and ending with one byte of x'00'.

`key_value` 
   value for the specific document to be retrieved.  

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful read, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

### znsq_update_result    

`int znsq_update_result(znsq_connection_t con, znsq_result_set_t result, const char *buf, size_t buf_len);`
			  
#### Update Documents after Reads for Update  
Updates existing documents previously retrieved by a (direct) znsq_read or a (sequential) znsq_next_result with the update options specified. An exclusive document level lock was obtained by the read requests.  For non-recoverable databases, the lock will be released immediately following the update result request, and for recoverable databases, the lock will be released by a znsq_commit, znsq_abort, or when the task ends. 

If the auto-commit option is active for the connection, then a commit will be issued following a successful update.   
             
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open. 
   
`znsq_result_set_t'
`   int32_t token returned by a previous znsq_read with the update option or znsq_next_result.       

`buf` 
   Contains a copy of the updated document to replace the existing version of the document.  All secondary indexes will be updated to relect any alternate key changes found in the  new version of the document.
   
`buf_len`  
   Length of buffer containing the updated document.    

#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful read, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of updating a document in an EzNoSQL database:

	           &rs,
	           update_buf_ptr,
	           &update_buf_len,
                  );

        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        free(update_buf_ptr);
        break;
      }
``` `

### znsq_commit    
`int znsq_commit(znsq_connection_t con);`
  
#### Commit Updates 
Issues a commit to end the current transaction and release document level locks.  The next write, delete, or update request will start a new transaction.
               
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open. 
   
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful commit, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of commiting transactions for an EzNoSQL database:
```
           
     return_code = znsq_commit(
        connection
     );
        
      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Error returned from znsq_commit()");
        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        free(read_buf_ptr);
        break;
      }
```   

### znsq_set_autocommit    
`int znsq_set_autocommit(znsq_connection_t con, const znsq_commit_options *options);`
  
#### Enable/Disable Auto Commit 
Updates the connection to the database to enable or disable the auto commit option.  When enabled, EzNoSQL will issue a commit after every update. Commits after every update request can incur overhead compared to optimizing commits for larger groups of updates. Conversely, commiting to infrequently can impact other sharers of the database from accessing the locked documents.  
               
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open. 
   
`options`
   Pointer to an object of type [`znsq_commit_options`](znsq_commit_options), where the set autocommit options are provided.   
   
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful commit, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of enabling auto commit for an EzNoSQL database:
```
     commit_options.znsq_autocommit = 1;                            //  Enables auto commit  
                
     return_code = znsq_set_autocommit(
        connection,
	&commit_options	
     );
        
      if (return_code != 0) {

        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        break;
      }
```   

### znsq_abort    
`int znsq_abort(znsq_connection_t con);`
  
#### Abort Updates 
Issues an abort to end the current transaction, restore updated documents to their original versions prior to the start of the transaction, and release the document level locks.  The next write, delete, or update request will start a new transaction.
               
#### Parameters

`znsq_connection_t` 
   C-constant contains the connection token from a previous znsq_open. 
   
#### Return value
The return code of the function. 

If successful abort, the return code is 0.

If an error occurred, the return code contains the detailed error reason. The macro `znsq_err` can be used to mask the error reason in bytes 
2 and 3 of the return code.

Example of commiting transactions for an EzNoSQL database:

        connection
     );
        
      if (return_code != 0) {
        Ilog("Error returned from znsq_abort()");
        Ilog("Return code received: X%x", znsq_err(return_code));
        free(read_buf_ptr);
        break;
      }
```

## Diagnostic Management

APIs in the Document Management section must run in non cross memory mode.
      
### znsq_last_result 

Use the znsq_last_result API to obtain a text report containing additional diagnostic information following an API failure.  The report is primarily intended for the system support staff.  The information can be logged by the application and referred to for problem determination.       

`int znsq_last_result(const char *buf, size_t buff_len);`

#### Parameters
`buf`                  The buf parameter is a required input parameter which will point to a buffer to receive the generated text report.  

`buff_len`             The buff_len is a required input/output parameter pointing to the length of the buffer, and on return the length of the report.  
```
Example call to znsq_last_result:
    size_t buffer_size = 32*1024;
    char *buffer = (char *) malloc(buffer_size);
    int z;
    char c;
    if (!buffer) {
        printf("FATAL ERROR - malloc()\n");
        return;
    }
    int err = znsq_last_result(&buffer_size, buffer);
    if (err) {
        printf("FATAL ERROR - znsq_last_result, rc=%08X\n", err);
        return;
    }
    
    printf("buffer addr %p, buffer size %d\n", buffer, buffer_size);
    for (z = 0; z <= buffer_size; z++) { 
         c = buffer[z];                    
         printf("%c",c);                     
    }                                        
    free(buffer);
  ```                                                         
#### Example Report 1

0001(X'01')  The database is not found in the catalog.  The database name passed on the API was 
             not found and was required for the successful completion of this API.

             Verify the database was successfully and has not been deleted created prior to issuing 
             this API. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0009(X'09')  Database not found. A database was not found on the znsq_destroy API. 
             
             Ensure if the database to be destroyed was created.             
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
00010(X'0A') Error Buffer too small.  Internal error indicating the error buffer is not large enough to 
             return additional error information.  Minumum size returned in error buffer size.

             Reissue the request with the correct size buffer.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
00011(X'0B') Missing parenthesis during znsq_create or znsq_add_index. Probable internal error when defining
             a base, alterante index, or path database (IDC3209I).   
             
             Report the problem to the z/OS Storage Administrator and if availble, provide the output from 
             the znsq_last_result report.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
00012(X'0C') Duplicate keyname for unique index.  znsq_add_index encountered a document in the database 
             which would result in a duplicate alternate key and the alternate (secondary) index was defined
             as unique.     
             
             Define the secondary index as non-unique, or remove the duplicate keyname from the document. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
00013(X'0D') Open failure while adding/enabling an alternate (secondary).  Most likely a znsq_add_index was
             issued for a previously defined and active index which has not be disabled via the 
             znsq_drop_index.
                          
             Issue a znsq_drop_index prior to re-enabling the alternate index.  Refer to the znsq_last_result
             report for more informatin on the actual open error.

00014(X'0E') SYSDSN Resource unavailable. The znsq_create_index could not obtain the SYSDSN databasename
             was not available.  The most likely reason is the database is currently allocated (in use).
             znsq_create_index can only be issued against fully disconnected databases. 
                                      
             If the database is currently connected, disconnect the database before issuing a 
             znsq_create_index.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
00016(X'10') Release of the SYSDSN Resource failed. The znsq_create_index failed when releasing the SYSDSN
             resource.  This is most likely an internal logic error. 
                                      
             Contact the z/OS Storage Administration for help in resolving this error.

0070(X'46')  Incompatiable lock error.  The same unit of recovery requested the same key in an incompatible
             state (e.g. two exclusive lock updates).  The request is failed.    

             The program may have a data access error trying to obtain the same document keys exclusively in
             the same unit of recovery record.  Correct the logic in the user program.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0071(X'47')  Deadlock time out occurred. Different units of recovery each are attemtping to lock two 
             different document keys in reversed order.  The deadlock is resolved by failing one of the
             requests.
             
             The program may expect this situation and can redrive the failed request.  The program may want 
             to improve the logic to avoid deadlocks which can impact performance.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0072(X'48')  A lock time out occurred. A read/write request timed out waiting for a document lock for the  
             specified key.  The timeout value specifed at open was greated than zero and the request waited 
             longer than the timeout value.
             
             The program may expect this situation and can take an action to release the held lock and redrive
             the failed request.  The timeout value may need to be increased to tolerate the expected wait 
             time. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0073(X'49')  Out of space. A write request attempt to extend the size of the database failed.   
                          
             The database may have reached its maximum size or there is not enough space on the available 
             volumes.

0080(X'50')  Memory obtain error. A read or write request attempted to obtain memory for internal control 
             blocks and the obtain failed.     
                          
             The program's memory may be exhausted.  If unexpected, report the problem to z/OS support for 
             help diagnosing the problem.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0081(X'51')  Buffer too small. A read request provided a too small buffer to hold the requested document.  The
             required size is returned in the buffer size field provided on the API.     
                          
             Obtain the correct buffer size and redrive the request.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0082(X'52')  Request Parameter List (RPL) reuse error. Multiple requests to access the database are using the
             same RPL. This is an internal logic error in the system software.
                                       
             Report the problem to z/OS support.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
0083(X'53')  Maximum number of concurrent requests exceeded the limit.  For each znsq_open, 1024 concurrent 
             requests are allowed.  Requests exceeding 1024 will be failed.
                                                    
             Reduce the number of concurrent requests or issue another znsq_open in the same program or other 
             sharing instances.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0084(X'54')  Illegal key change.  An update request for a document through an alternate index attemted to change 
             the primary key.  Primary keys cannot be changed once the document is inserted. 
                                                                 
             Correct the document to ensure the primary key has not been changed. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________             
0085(X'55')  No keyname found.  A write request provided a document that does not contain a key that matches the
             keyname on the znsq_create. Either the keyname is not in the JSON document, or the JSON document 
             itself is of an invalid structure.  
                                                                 
             Ensure the document contains the required keyname or is a valid JSON document.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0086(X'56')  Incomplete document found. A read request attempted to return a document that has an imcomplete  
             length.  The write of the original document may have failed and was only partially writted to disk.
             This type of error may occur for non-recoverable (logOptions(NONE)) databases. Recoverable databases
             (logOptions(UNDO)) would have backed out the damaged document after the unit of reocvery was backed
             out or retried  
                                                                 
             The damaged document may still be deleted from the data set.  Use recoverable data sets to avoid
             damaged data sets.  The logOptions attribute is returned on the `znsq_report_stats` API.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0087(X'57')  Request Parameter List (RPL) error. Invalid RPL options were specified by the system code. One 
             example would be when attempting sequential writes/updates/deletes to the primary index set). 
	     Using sequential access (i.e znsq_position) for updates/deletes is only applicable to secondary
	     indexes.
                                       
             To update the primary index, use znsq_read for update followed by znsq_updated_result or 
	     znsq_delete_result.  If an error is still received, capture the znsq_last_result diagnostic 
	     information and report the problem to the z/OS support.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0088(X'58')  Invalid user environment. The user's program is executing in cross memory mode.  znsq API calls must 
             not be issued in cross memory.
                                       
             Correct the environment the user program is executing in to non cross memory.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0089(X'59')  Invalid index pointers. The database's index is corrupted.  This is likely a system software defect.
                                       
             For the primary index, the database may need to be redefined and reloaded to rebuild the index.  For
             alternate indexes, a znsq_drop_index followed by a znsq_add_index will rebuild the index.  Save a copy 
             of the damaged database and report the problem to the z/OS Storage Administrator.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0090(X'5A')  Access type not allowed. A write, update, or erase request was issued against a database opened for 
             input (read) only.
                                       
             If write access is required, open the database for output if eligible.             
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0091(X'5B')  Retained lock failure. A request to obtain a document level lock has failed because the lock is in a
             retained state from a previous transaction, which has either failed to back out (transaction shunted),
             or has closed the database and not yet issued a commit or abort.  The request to obtain the lock is
             failed until such a time the owning transaction (URID) completes the transaction. 
                                       
             Ensure all transactions are committed before closing the database to limit the window retain locks may
             be enccountered.  It the transaction owning the lock has become shunted, contact the system storage

0096(X'60')  Incomplete document found. A read request attempted to return a document that has an imcomplete  
             document segment.  The write of the original document may have failed and was only partially writted to
             disk. This type of error may occur for non-recoverable (logOptions(NONE)) databases. Recoverable data 
             sets (logOptions(UNDO)) would have backed out the damaged document after the unit of reocvery was 
             backed out or retried  
                                                                 
             The damaged document may still be deleted from the data set.  Use recoverable data sets to avoid
             damaged data sets.  The logOptions attribute is returned on the `znsq_report_stats` API.

             Rebuilding the index can correct the problem by issuing a znsq_drop_index (or znsq_destroy the index), 
             followed by a znsq_add_index).  Saving a copy of the primary and secondary indexes prior to rebuilding
             the index may help diagnose the inconsistencey.
